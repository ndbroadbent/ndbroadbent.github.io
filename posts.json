It took a lot of help from other people before I solved all of the problems I was having. A few hints would be:\\n\\n- Never use ndiswrapper with rt73 wireless devices.

The headset must also be turned on and connected while you follow these steps. Ubuntu should automatically create bluez audio devices for you in PulseAudio.\\n\\nThese are the steps that worked for me. YMMV with other headset brands/models.\\n\\n<ol>\\n\t<li>Install PulseAudio utils :  $ sudo apt-get install paprefs paman padevchooser</li>\\n\t<li>Once installed, go to Applications-&gt;Sound &amp; Video-&gt;PulseAudio Device Chooser. This will add a black microphone jack icon to your system tray.</li>\\n\t<li>Do a left-click on the jack icon and a menu appears. In this menu, choose \\\"Manager\\\". A new window appears.</li>\\n\t<li>If it's not already connected, click on the \\\"Connect\\\" button to connect to your local PulseAudio server. When connected, you will see details about it listed.</li>\\n\t<li>Click on the Devices tab. Under \\\"Sinks\\\" you should see an entry for \\\"bluez_sink.XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX\\\".</li>\\n\t<li>Click 'properties' for the 'bluez_sink' device. Highlight the \\\"Name:\\\" of the device (you can do this with a triple-leftclick of your mouse), and press Ctrl+C.</li>\\n\t<li>Now go to the Sample Cache tab. You are shown a list of sounds. Choose an OGG file from this list. At the bottom is a \\\"Playback on\\\" drop-down. Choose \\\"bluez_sink.XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX\\\" from this list and click on the Play button. You should hear a Ubuntu system sound through your speakers. This proves to us that PulseAudio can play through your Bluetooth headset (but this is NOT the redirection - this is just a test).</li>\\n\t<li>Close the PulseAudio Manager.</li>\\n\t<li>Do another left-click on the mic jack icon in your system tray.</li>\\n\t<li>Go to \\\"Default Sink\\\" and then choose \\\"Other\\\" from the sub-menu. A window appears.</li>\\n\t<li>In this window, press Ctrl+V to paste the device name that we copied earlier, and click OK.</li>\\n\t<li>Play a sound from somewhere, eg: MP3 or movie in Totem. You should now hear your audio coming through your Bluetooth headset! <em>NOTE: Existing audio streams at the time of changing the sink will continue to play through whatever they were playing through until stopped and started again.</em></li>\\n\t<li>To switch back to your speakers, simply click on the mic jack icon again, choose \\\"Default Sink\\\" and choose \\\"Default\\\" from the sub-menu. The next audio stream played will go back through your speakers.</li>\\n\t<li>To make the PulseAudio Device Chooser start automatically on startup, click on the mic jack icon again, choose Preferences from the menu and then click on \\\"Start applet on Session Login\\\" in the window.</li>\\n\t<li>Enjoy! <img title=\\\"Stick Out Tongue\\\" src=\\\"https://forums.overclockers.com.au/content/images/smilies/tongue.gif\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></li>\\n</ol>\\nAlso note: Any application (including Skype) <strong>should</strong> be able to play audio through the headset if you follow these steps. If you want to use Skype, you will also need to set up the mic on the headset by following the same steps to configure the bluez source device (‘bluez_source.XX…’) as the 'Default Source'.\\n\\nI was able to record and playback audio fine with Audacity, and a test call on Skype worked fine.\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

I was going to write a GIMP plugin to extract out multiple images from a single scanned image of 3 or 4 photos, and then rotate them automatically. But as always, someone had already beat me to it :)\\n\\nSee <a href=\\\"http://www.gimptalk.com/forum/divide-or-crop-multiple-images-from-single-scan-t36438s0.html\\\">this forum on GimpTalk</a> for the original script.\\n\\n(The only problem I had is that the <a href=\\\"http://registry.gimp.org/node/2958\\\">Deskew</a> plugin for GIMP is located on a website whose server seems to be permanently offline. I did manage to find an alternative location, so I've posted a self-hosted link to the plugin below)\\n\\n<strong>Steps to scan in multiple images:</strong>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\t<li>Download <a href=\\\"http://ffaat.pointclark.net/incoming/scripts/DivideScannedImages.scm\\\">DivideScannedImages.scm</a> to  <em>~/.gimp-2.6/scripts</em></li>\\n\t<li>Download <a href=\\\"/content/files/2010/05/deskew\\\">deskew</a> to<em> /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins</em></li>\\n\t<li>Start GIMP</li>\\n\t<li>Click Filters -&gt; Batch Tools -&gt; Batch Divide Scanned Images</li>\\n</ol>\\nThe rest is easy to figure out. Just make sure your 'size threshold' is large enough. Also, it may help to cover the photos with a couple of sheets of A4 paper, to give an even white background. Then place a few photos (3 or 4) on the scanner, with adequate spaces between them, scan them, and let the plugin do the rest!\\n\\nThanks to <strong> <a href=\\\"https://www.gimptalk.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10783\\\">RobA</a> </strong> <img title=\\\"Offline\\\" src=\\\"https://www.gimptalk.com/forum/styles/GimpTalkPro/imageset/en/icon_user_offline.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Offline\\\" />for the awesome script!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2010/05/scan1-resized-post.jpg\\\" />\\n\\n<h2>becomes</h2>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"gallery\\\">\\n    <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2010/05/scan1-a.jpg\\\" />\\n    <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2010/05/scan1-b.jpg\\\" />\\n    <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2010/05/scan1-c.jpg\\\" />\\n</div>\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

Program then replaces the carrier name in the top left corner with the parsed balance. It does this by altering the com.nspwn.fakeoperatorpreferences plist, and then notifying FakeOperator to update SpringBoard.\\n\\nAlso includes a launchd script that schedules the program to be executed every half hour.\\n\\n<strong>Tags</strong>\\n\\nThis project might also be useful if you need to learn how to:\\n\\n- Compile an iPhone program for iOS 4.1/4.2\\n- Run a script or application on iOS 4.1/4.2 at a scheduled interval (with launchd)\\n- Send AT commands to the iPhone/iPad modem (programmatically send SMS/dial numbers/etc)\\n- Write plist files to alter preferences for another application\\n\\n<strong>Why</strong>\\n\\nMy carrier (PCCW) doesn’t believe in sending SMS alerts when my balance is about to, or even has, run out. I’ve emailed them about it, but thats just the way it is. So I thought this would be a better alternative to getting a new number.\\n\\nWould be happy to help anyone alter this for their own carriers, if requested. However, some operators do weird stuff like SMS every time you send an AT command like this, so that would be annoying.\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

One way of speeding up commonly used commands is by binding them to\\nkeyboard shortcuts.\\n\\nKeyboard shortcuts are turned off by default,\\nbut here are the default key bindings if you enable them:\\n\\n- `CTRL`+`SPACE` => `git_status_shortcuts` - show git status with file shortcuts\\n- `CTRL`+`x` `c` => `git_add_and_commit` - add given files (if any), then commit staged changes\\n- `CTRL`+`x` `SPACE` => `git_commit_all` - commit everything\\n\\nThe commit shortcuts use the `git_commit_prompt` function, which gives a simple prompt like this:\\n\\n<div class=\\\"centered\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2011/10/git_commit_all-resized-post.png\\\" alt=\\\"Git Commit All\\\" />\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n(When using bash, this commit prompt gives you access to your bash history via the arrow keys.)\\n<br/>\\n\\nAnd if you really want to speed up your workflow, you can type this:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ 2 3 <CTRL+x c>\\n```\\n\\nThis sends the `HOME` key, followed by `git_add_and_commit`:\\n\\n<div class=\\\"centered\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2011/10/git_add_and_commit_params-resized-post.png\\\" alt=\\\"Git Add And Commit\\\" />\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"repository-index\\\">Repository Index</h2>\\n\\nThe second feature is a repository index for all of your projects and submodules.\\nThis gives you super-fast switching between your project directories, with tab completion,\\nand it can even tab-complete down to project subdirectories.\\nThis means that you can keep your projects organized in subfolders,\\nbut switch between them as easily as if they were all in one folder.\\n\\nIt's similar to [autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump), but it doesn't need to 'learn' anything,\\nand it can do SCM-specific stuff like:\\n\\n- Running a command for all of your repos (useful if you ever need to update a lot of remote URLs)\\n- Auto-updating a repo when you switch to it and it hasn't been updated for at least 5 hours.\\n\\nThe default alias for `git_index` is 's', which could stand for 'source' or 'switch' :)\\n\\nYou will first need to configure your repository directory, and then build the index:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ s --rebuild\\n\\n# => == Scanning /home/ndbroadbent/src for git repos & submodules...\\n\\n# => ===== Indexed 64 repos in /home/ndbroadbent/src/.git_index\\n\\n```\\n\\nThen you'll be able to switch between your projects, or show the list of indexed repos:\\n\\n<div class=\\\"centered\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2011/10/source_list-resized-post.png\\\" alt=\\\"Git Status With Shortcuts\\\" />\\n</div>\\n<br/><br/>\\n\\nTo switch to a project directory, you don't need to type the full project name. For example,\\nto switch to the `errbit` project, you could type any of the following:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ s errbit\\n$ s err\\n$ s rbit\\n```\\n\\nOr if you wanted to go straight to a subdirectory within `errbit`:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ s err<TAB>\\n$ s errbit/<TAB>\\n\\n# => app/ autotest/ config/ db/ ...\\n\\n$ s errbit/conf<TAB>\\n$ s errbit/config/\\n\\n# => cd ~/src/rails/errbit/config\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Anything else?\\n\\nIf you have any awesome SCM scripts lurking in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`,\\nplease feel free to send me a pull request.\\nIt would be cool to make this project into an [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for SCMs.\\n\\n# Installation\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone git://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze.git ~/.scm_breeze\\n~/.scm_breeze/install.sh\\nsource ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc\\n```\\n\\n(The install script simply appends the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):\\n\\n`[ -s \\\"$HOME/.scm_breeze/scm_breeze.sh\\\" ] && . \\\"$HOME/.scm_breeze/scm_breeze.sh\\\"`\\n\\n# Configuration\\n\\nSCM Breeze is configured via automatically installed `~/.*.scmbrc` files.\\nTo change git configuration, edit `~/.git.scmbrc`.\\n\\n**Note:** After changing any settings, you will need to run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc`)\\n\\nI know we grow attached to the aliases we use every day, so I've made them completely customizable.\\nJust change any aliases in `~/.git.scmbrc`.

Google's Chrome browser is now available on iOS, and the author of the article was talking about how app developers could be persuaded to add some code to their apps which would allow Chrome to open links.\\n\\nRestrictions like this (not being able to change your default browser) are one of the many reasons why I wouldn't buy another iPhone if it couldn't be jailbroken.\\nIt also seems strange that 'Hacker News' readers don't appear to be very excited about 'hacking' the incredible device in their pockets.\\n\\nWe don't need to ask developers to support Chrome when we can just change the default browser ourselves:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2012/07/browser_changer.png\\\" alt=\\\"Changing Default Browser\\\" />\\n\\nYou can find the \\\"[Browser Changer](https://cydia.saurik.com/package/jp.tom-go.openopera)\\\" package on [Cydia](https://cydia.saurik.com/).\\n\\n**Here's 9 other reasons why a jailbroken iPhone is better than any other mobile device:**\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### Grooveshark\\n\\nThe Grooveshark iPhone app was removed from the App Store, so you can only install it on a jailbroken iPhone through Cydia.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2012/07/grooveshark.png\\\" alt=\\\"Grooveshark\\\" />\\n\\nThe 'Grooveshark Anywhere' plan is required if you want to download unlimited albums and songs to play offline, but it's well worth the $9 per month.\\nIt's definitely a replacement for iTunes, so it's no wonder that Apple feels threatened.\\n\\n<small>Note: I also tried Spotify for a week when it was released to New Zealand, but I found that Grooveshark has a much bigger music collection.</small>\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### SSH\\n\\nHaving SSH access to your phone opens up a lot of possibilities. For example, I use [capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/) to deploy iPhone apps and Cydia packages while I'm developing them.\\nI can also SFTP into the iPhone's filesystem, and use Ubuntu's file browser to copy and paste files.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### VLC media player\\n\\nPlays anything you can transfer to your iPhone. Another great app rejected from the App Store.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### Mobile Terminal\\n\\nIt's pretty neat to have a terminal on your phone, even if I don't use it very often.\\nYou never know when you might need to restart or rollback a remote server:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2012/07/terminal.png\\\" alt=\\\"Terminal\\\" />\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### SBSettings\\n\\nThis is an incredibly useful shortcuts menu, displayed by swiping the status bar:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2012/07/sbsettings.png\\\" alt=\\\"SBSettings\\\" />\\n\\nThe AutoLock control is really handy when using the Maps application. I use Maps as the GPS for my car, and I don't want the screen to turn off while I'm driving.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### MyWi - 3G tethering\\n\\nI bought the MyWi package while using a 3GS. It's pretty expensive at $19.99,\\nbut it was a lifesaver when I was living without DSL for a few weeks.\\nI'm still using it after getting a 4S, since iOS 5's 'personal hotspot' feature was a bit flaky.\\nMyWi is rock-solid, and can display a small icon instead of taking over the entire status bar like the iOS hotspot.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### 5 columns for icons\\n\\nThis is just my personal preference, but I like having 5 icons in my dock and home screen.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2012/07/five-icons.png\\\" alt=\\\"Five Icons\\\" />\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### Compiling and installing any open source iPhone apps\\n\\nNo $99 developer license required. One example is the [Last.FM](https://github.com/c99koder/lastfm-iphone) app, which is open source, but not available in NZ or HK iTunes stores.\\nHere's a decent list of some other [open source iPhone apps](https://maniacdev.com/2010/06/35-open-source-iphone-app-store-apps-updated-with-10-new-apps/).\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### Script anything\\n\\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, it's just awesome to be able to script the phone to do whatever I want.\\nFor example, I can make the iPhone [change the wallpaper every 30 minutes](/2011/07/20/automatically-change-iphone-wallpaper-every-30-minutes/), [show my prepaid balance in the status bar](/2010/12/26/ios-tweak-replace-operator-with-current-prepaid-balance/), or [scroll up and down a page when it tilts](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/quickscrollplus).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nJailbroken iPhones FTW.\\n\\nPlease leave a comment if you have any tips to share!\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

If you haven't seen it already, take a look at my [blog post that describes what it can do](/2011/10/19/git-shortcuts-like-youve-never-seen-before/).\\n\\nHere were my goals when I set out to find a solution:\\n\\n- I wanted a design directory for each of my projects\\n- I didn't want the design directory to be checked in to the git repository\\n- The design directory needed to be synchronized across all of my machines\\n\\nI decided that I would need to store all of my design files in one place so that they could be easily\\nsynchronized, and I would create symlinks from each project to the root design directory.\\n\\nThe simplest way for me to synchronize files was via my Dropbox account.\\nHowever, if you work with a larger team, you could set up a shared design directory on one\\nof your servers and synchronize it with `rsync`.\\n\\nEither way, here's how you can effectively manage your design assets for git projects:\\n\\n## 1) Install SCM Breeze\\n\\nThis gives you the `design()` function, as well as a bunch of other features that you can [read about here](/2011/10/19/git-shortcuts-like-youve-never-seen-before/).\\n\\nTo install, run:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone git://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze.git ~/.scm_breeze\\n~/.scm_breeze/install.sh\\nsource ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc\\n```\\n\\n## 2) Create and configure a root design directory\\n\\nI created my root design directory at `~/Dropbox/Design`.\\n\\nAfter you've created your root design directory, edit `~/.scmbrc` and set `root_design_dir`\\nto the directory you just created.\\nYou can also configure the design directory that's created in each of your projects\\n(default: `design_assets`), as well as the subdirectories you would like to use.\\nThe default base subdirectories are: Images, Backgrounds, Logos, Icons, Mockups, and Screenshots.\\n\\nAfter you have changed these settings, remember to run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`.\\n\\n## 3) Initialize design directories for your projects\\n\\nTo set up the design directories and symlinks, go to a project's directory and run:\\n\\n```bash\\ndesign init\\n```\\n\\nIf your root directory is `~/Dropbox/Design`, directories will be created at\\n`~/Dropbox/Design/projects/my_project/Backgrounds`, `~/Dropbox/Design/projects/my_project/Icons`, etc.\\n\\nIt will then symlink the project from your root design directory into your project's design directory,\\nso you end up with:\\n\\n- `my_project/design_assets` -> `~/Dropbox/Design/projects/my_project`\\n\\nIt also adds this directory to `.git/info/exclude` so that git ignores it.\\n\\nHere's the awesome part: If you use the SCM Breeze git repository index,\\nyou can run the following batch command to set up these directories for all of your git repos at once:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit_index --batch-cmd design init\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to remove any empty design directories, run:\\n\\n```bash\\ndesign trim\\n```\\n\\nAnd if you want to remove all of a project's design directories, even if they contain files:\\n\\n```bash\\ndesign rm\\n```\\n\\n## 4) Link existing design directories into your projects\\n\\nIf you've set up your design directories on one machine, you'll want them\\nto be synchronized across all of your other development machines.\\n\\nJust run the following command on your other machines after following steps 1 and 2:\\n\\n```bash\\ndesign link\\n```\\n\\nThis uses your git index (from SCM Breeze) to figure out where to create the symlinks.\\nIf you don't use the git index, the same outcome could be achieved by running 'design init'\\nfor each of the projects.\\n\\n## Enjoy!\\n\\nPlease leave a comment on this blog post if you have any questions.\\nIf you find a bug, or it doesn't work quite right on your operating system,\\n[please raise an issue on Github](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze/issues).\\n\\n## Shameless Dropbox Referral\\n\\nIf you don't already use Dropbox, [click here to sign up!](https://db.tt/hN3mN1W) It's an awesome service!\\nAnd if you sign up via that referral link, you'll be giving me a little extra free space :)\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

Add the following lines to your `.travis.yml`:\\n\\n```ruby\\nenv:\\n\\n- DB=mysql\\n- DB=postgres\\n- DB=sqlite\\n```\\n\\n### Database configuration\\n\\nWe package multiple example database configurations for each of our supported databases, like this:\\n\\n- `config/database.mysql.yml`\\n- `config/database.postgres.yml`\\n- `config/database.sqlite.yml`\\n\\nWe also have a rake task that is a prequisite for the `spec` task, and this sets up the example configuration files for Travis.\\n\\nIt copies the `database.yml` template specified by our `DB` variable, using postgres as the default.\\n\\n```ruby\\nFileUtils.cp \\\"config/database.#{ENV['DB'] || 'postgres'}.yml\\\", 'config/database.yml'\\n```\\n\\n### Gemfile.ci\\n\\nI created a new Gemfile for CI. It simply tells bundler to use the gem specified by our `DB` variable,\\nprevents any other database gems from being loaded, and then loads the 'real' Gemfile.\\n\\nHere's the contents of `Gemfile.ci`:\\n\\n```ruby\\ncase ENV['DB']\\nwhen \\\"mysql\\\"; gem \\\"mysql2\\\", \\\"0.3.10\\\"\\nwhen \\\"sqlite\\\"; gem \\\"sqlite3\\\"\\nwhen \\\"postgres\\\"; gem \\\"pg\\\", \\\">= 0.9.0\\\"\\nend\\n\\ndef gem(\\*args)\\n\\n# Override 'gem' method to block any other database gems in the 'real' Gemfile\\n\\nsuper unless %w(pg sqlite3 mysql2).include?(args.first)\\nend\\n\\n# Eval Gemfile\\n\\neval(IO.read(File.join(File.dirname(**FILE**), 'Gemfile')), binding)\\n```\\n\\nThat's all there is to it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis is a slightly unrelated topic, but I had a lot of trouble getting our new `Gemfile.ci` to work properly.\\nAfter a serious headache, I figured out that we hadn't updated `config/boot.rb`\\nto the latest version after our upgrade.\\nThis new `boot.rb` had a very subtle difference, and contained the following line:\\n\\n```ruby\\nENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] ||= File.expand_path('../../Gemfile', **FILE**)\\n```\\n\\ninstead of:\\n\\n```ruby\\nENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] = gemfile\\n```\\n\\nNotice the `||=`, which meant that the `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` variable could actually have an effect when it was set by Travis.\\n\\nYou might have found this post if you are googling for `Could not find multi_json-1.0.3 in any of the sources`, which is\\nthe symptom that I was experiencing (due to an updated gem and an outdated `Gemfile.lock`).\\nIn that case, you may need to update your `config/boot.rb` to [the latest version from Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/app/templates/config/boot.rb).\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

You've probably seen some 'build status' badges like this:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-ci.png\\\" alt=\\\"Travis CI build status\\\">\\n\\nWouldn't it be cool if you could see that build status in your shell prompt whenever you are working on a project?\\n\\nHere's what my shell prompt looks like now:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2012/01/travis_ci_prompt.png\\\" alt=\\\"Travis CI status in prompt\\\" />\\n\\nThis shows the build status for the current branch.\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou will need to cache the build status, since looking it up takes a few seconds.\\n\\nYou should use my fork of [mislav's](https://github.com/mislav) `travis-ci` script, which can check the build status of a project. Make sure `~/bin` is in your `PATH`, and if you are using RVM, make sure you are using your default ruby.\\n\\nRun the following to install it:\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir -p ~/bin/\\ncurl -sL https://raw.github.com/gist/1708408/travis.rb > ~/bin/travis-ci \\\\n && chmod +x ~/bin/travis-ci\\n\\ngem install hub | tail -2\\nruby -e 'require \\\"json\\\"' 2>/dev/null || gem install json\\n```\\n\\nNext, we need to update the cached status.\\nThe following code is included as part of my [SCM Breeze project](/2011/10/19/git-shortcuts-like-youve-never-seen-before/), but feel free to save the `update_travis_ci_status` script <a href=\\\"#update_travis_ci_status\\\">at the bottom of this post [1]</a> to `/usr/bin/update_travis_ci_status`.\\n\\nWe will also need a way to run this update task every few minutes, across all of our local git repos.\\nWe only want to frequently update the status for the currently checked out branch, and periodically update the status for all branches.\\n\\nThe [SCM Breeze project](/2011/10/19/git-shortcuts-like-youve-never-seen-before/) also maintains an index of your git repositories, which gives you the ability to run batch commands via the `git_index` function.\\nSo the build status update can be easily set up as a cron task:\\n\\n```text\\n_/5 _ \\* \\* _ /bin/bash -c '. $HOME/.bashrc && git_index --rebuild && git_index --batch-cmd update_travis_ci_status'\\n_/45 \\* \\* \\* \\* /bin/bash -c '. $HOME/.bashrc && git_index --rebuild && export UPDATE_ALL_BRANCHES=true && git_index --batch-cmd update_travis_ci_status'\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you could save the following script to `/usr/bin/update_all_travis_ci_statuses`.\\n\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\n# (Replace `$HOME/code` with the location of your projects)\\n\\nfor f in find \\\"$HOME/code\\\" -maxdepth 4 -name .travis.yml; do\\n  (builtin cd \\\"$(dirname $f)\\\" && update_travis_ci_status)\\ndone\\n```\\n\\n... and use the following cron task:\\n\\n```text\\n_/5 _ \\* \\* _ /bin/bash -c '. $HOME/.bashrc && /usr/bin/update_all_travis_ci_statuses'\\n_/45 \\* \\* \\* \\* /bin/bash -c '. $HOME/.bashrc && export UPDATE_ALL_BRANCHES=true && /usr/bin/update_all_travis_ci_statuses'\\n```\\n\\n(you need to source your `.bashrc` if your default ruby comes from RVM)\\n\\nFinally, you need a way to display the cached status in your prompt.\\n\\nHere are the functions I use to return a colored pass / fail / running symbol:\\n\\n```bash\\n\\n# Returns the Travis CI status for a github project\\n\\nparse_travis_status() {\\nlocal branch=\\\"$1\\\"\\n  if [ -z \\\"$branch\\\" ]; then branch=\\\"master\\\"; fi\\n\\nlocal stat_file=$(find_in_cwd_or_parent \\\".travis_status~\\\")\\n  if [ -e \\\"$stat_file\\\" ]; then\\ncase \\\"$(grep -m 1 \\\"^$branch \\\" \\\"$stat_file\\\")\\\" in\\n*passed) echo \\\"\\[\\e[01;32m\\]✔ \\\";; # green\\n*failed) echo \\\"\\[\\e[01;31m\\]✘ \\\";; # red\\n\\*running) echo \\\"\\[\\e[01;33m\\]⁇ \\\";; # yellow\\nesac\\nfi\\n}\\n\\n# Test whether file exists in current or parent directories\\n\\nfind_in_cwd_or_parent() {\\nlocal slashes=${PWD//[^\\/]/}; local directory=$PWD;\\nfor (( n=${#slashes}; n>0; --n )); do\\n    test -e $directory/$1 && echo \\\"$directory/$1\\\" && return 0\\n    directory=$directory/..\\ndone\\nreturn 1\\n}\\n```\\n\\n(it also works if you are in a project's sub-directory.)\\n\\nFinally, add `$(parse_travis_status \\\"$current_branch\\\")` somewhere in your `$PS1`. You should set the `$current_branch` variable to the current git branch, but it defaults to the `master` branch if you leave it blank.\\n\\nYou may like to have a look at the [prompt section of my dotfiles](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/dotfiles/blob/master/bashrc/prompt.sh), to see how I do it.\\n\\nEnjoy!

However, Google Groups only lets you invite 10 emails at a time,\\nso here's a Bash/Zsh script that will print all of your contributor emails as CSV, in groups of 10:\\n\\n```bash\\nemails=( $(git log --format='%ae' | sort -u) )\\ntotal_groups=$(( ${#emails[@]} / 10 ))\\n\\nfor ((i=0; i <= $total_groups; i++)); do\\n  echo \\\"Group $((i + 1)):\\\"\\n  echo \\\"-------------------------------------------------------\\\"\\n  grouped_emails=( ${emails[@]:$(( $i * 10 )):10} )\\n  printf \\\"%s, \\\" \\\"${grouped_emails[@]}\\\" | cut -d \\\",\\\" -f 1-${#grouped_emails[@]}\\necho\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nAfter pasting this script into your terminal, you can copy and paste each batch of\\nemails into the **Enter email addresses of people to invite** textarea.\\nBut be careful to write and save your invite message in your text editor, because if you\\nwrite it on the page you won't be able to get it back after sending the first batch of invites.\\n\\nIt will still be quite a tedious process since you'll need to enter a captcha for each batch,\\nbut hopefully this script will save you some time.\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

        "mobiledoc": "{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\nA day in the life of a Rails developer will usually involve a few `git pull`s, `bundle install`s, and switching between different projects. I thought it would be great if my projects could be automatically kept up-to-date, so that I don't have to spend too much time updating code or installing new gems.\\n\\nI'm using the `whenever` gem to create cron tasks that:\\n\\n- Update all my git repos from their remotes\\n- Satisfy all of my Gemfile's dependencies\\n- Cache rake and capistrano commands for tab completion\\n- Fetch Travis CI build statuses to show in my terminal\\n- Maintain an index of my git repos so I can quickly switch between projects, while keeping them organized\\n\\nFor all of these tasks, I'm using the `git_index` function provided by my [SCM Breeze](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze) project. It creates an index of all your git projects by recursively scanning your code directory, and then lets you quickly jump to projects, or run batch commands for each of your repos. See my [SCM Breeze blog post for more info about the repository index](/2011/10/19/git-shortcuts-like-youve-never-seen-before/#repository-index).\\n\\n### Updating Git Repos\\n\\nEvery 30 minutes I run a task that updates all of the local branches on all of my git repos. It does this as safely as possible:\\n\\n- Doesn't do anything if there are any changed files in the working directory\\n- Doesn't do anything unless remote and merge branches are explicitly configured for that branch\\n- Doesn't do anything if it cannot 'fast-forward' merge a branch (i.e. the current commit is not a parent of the latest commit in the remote repo)\\n\\nBasically, this means that it will leave you alone if you are working on a feature, or if you've committed something that you haven't pushed yet.\\n\\nOtherwise, it will bring your branches up-to-date and send a desktop notification:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2012/10/git_update_notify.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Git update notification\\\" />\\n\\n### Installing Gem dependencies\\n\\nI have a task that runs every hour to ensure that all of my gem dependencies are installed. If someone adds a new gem dependency to your project, it's great to have that automatically installed when the repo is automatically updated.\\n\\nI'm using the `git_index` function to run a script called [bundle_check_or_install](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/bundle_check_or_install) for each of my git repos. It also sends desktop notifications on update or failure, and doesn't do anything if the gems are already up-to-date.\\n\\nIf `bundle install` fails for any reason, it will touch a file at `'.skip_bundle_auto_install~` (and exclude that file from git by adding it to `.git/info/exclude`). Any future attempts to auto-update your gems will abort with the notification that \\\"Previous bundle install failed\\\". This notification can be disabled if `.skip_bundle_auto_install~` contains the string \\\"SILENT\\\". I do this when I stop caring about old projects, but don't want to delete or archive them.\\n\\n### Caching Rake and Capistrano commands for tab completion\\n\\n`rake -T` and `cap -T` can take a long time to run, so I run a task every hour to cache the available tasks for all of my projects, and I use these cached tasks to provide tab completion. The tasks in saved to files like `.cached_rake_tasks~` and `.cached_cap_tasks~`. [Here's how I set up the Bash tab completion](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/dotfiles/blob/master/bashrc/ruby_on_rails.sh#L99).\\n\\n### Fetching Travis CI Build Status\\n\\nI've written about this before in my [Travis CI Status in Shell Prompt](/2012/01/14/travis-ci-status-in-shell-prompt/) post. Every 30 minutes I run a task to fetch build statuses for all the repos that contain a `.travis.yml` file. The status is saved in a hidden file called `.travis_status~`, and displayed in my prompt like this:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2012/01/travis_ci_prompt.png\\\" alt=\\\"Travis CI status in prompt\\\" />\\n\\n### Updating Git Repo Index\\n\\nAll of the previous tasks depend on the git repo index being up-to-date. It only takes a few seconds to scan through my code directories, so I run this task every minute.\\n\\nThis index lets me keep my code organized in different folders, while also letting me jump to different projects by name:\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2011/10/source_list-resized-post.png\\\" alt=\\\"Git Status With Shortcuts\\\" />\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\nIf you want to set this up for yourself, you'll need to check out my [SCM Breeze](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze) project. The `schedule.rb` that defines these tasks [lives in my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/dotfiles/blob/master/schedule.rb), and you can find the scripts I use in the [/bin](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/) directory.\\n\\nPost a comment if you have any automation ideas to share!\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

The script will automatically strip the trailing **:in**, so you can just double-click instead of manually highlighting.\\n\\n### Requirements\\n\\n- Ubuntu\\n- xclip (install with `sudo apt-get install xclip`)\\n- A text editor, such as [Sublime Text 2](https://www.sublimetext.com/2).\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\n- Download the [open_selected_in_editor](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/open_selected_in_editor) script to somewhere like `~/bin`.\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir -p ~/bin\\nwget https://raw.github.com/ndbroadbent/dotfiles/master/bin/open_selected_in_editor -O ~/bin/open_selected_in_editor\\nchmod +x ~/bin/open_selected_in_editor\\n```\\n\\n- Modify the script to use your preferred text editor\\n\\n### Set up current working directory support\\n\\nAdd the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:\\n\\n```bash\\nPROMPT_COMMAND+=\\\"pwd > ~/.cwd~;\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis means that every time you press return in the terminal, the script can use your current directory to determine an absolute path for a highlighted file. It's not completely foolproof, but good enough for me.\\n\\n### Set up a keyboard shortcut in Ubuntu 12.04\\n\\n- Go to **System Settings** -> **Keyboard** -> **Shortcuts** -> **Custom Shortcuts**\\n- Click the **+** to add a new shortcut with:\\n  - Name: **Open selected in editor**\\n  - Command: **~/bin/open_selected_in_editor**\\n- Set the keyboard shortcut. I like _Ctrl+Shift+X_.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/03/keyboard_shortcuts.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Ubuntu Keyboard Shortcuts\\\" />\\n\\nAll done! Now you can highlight a filename in the terminal, press your keyboard shortcut, and open it in your editor without the need to copy & paste filenames. Please let me know if you need any help, but I'm sorry I don't know how to do this in OS X or Windows.\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

Here's all the PCB revisions, before I settled on a design that would fit neatly on top of the microwave's original PCB.\\n\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/pcb_1.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/pcb_1-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"PCB revision 1\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/pcb_2.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/pcb_2-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"PCB revision 2\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/pcb_3.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/pcb_3-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"PCB revision 3\\\" />\\n</a>\\n\\nI used shift registers and optocouplers to control the touchpad pins. To listen for touchpad presses, an output shift register scans one line at a time on the first touchpad layer, and an input shift register listens for connections to the second layer.\\n\\nI unsoldered the touchpad connector from the original circuit board, and replaced it with a row of pin headers. I then used the original touchpad connector on my PCB, so that my circuit acts as a kind of proxy for button presses.\\n\\nHere's the final product after transferring toner, etching, drilling, and soldering. (I had to use the ribbon cables to save space.)\\n\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/ready_to_etch.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/ready_to_etch-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Ready to Etch\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/soldered.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/soldered-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Everything Soldered\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/pcb_bottom.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/pcb_bottom-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"PCB Bottom\\\" />\\n</a>\\n\\nAnd here's how it fits on top of the microwave controller:\\n\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/plugged_in1.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/plugged_in1-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Plugged In\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/plugged_in2.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/plugged_in2-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Plugged In\\\" />\\n</a>\\n\\nWhen I peeled off the old touchpad overlay, it became wrinkled and ugly, so I thought I may as well have a go at redesigning the interface. My goal was to get rid of the features I don't really use, and make the basic functions more convenient. The top two rows of buttons are now dedicated to \\\"one touch\\\" cooking times, for either \\\"high\\\" or \\\"medium\\\" power. You can also set the time and power manually.\\n\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/touchpad.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox\\\" width=\\\"145\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/touchpad-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Touchpad\\\" />\\n</a>\\n\\nYou might have noticed that I started the project with the intention of using an [Arduino Nano](https://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano) plugged into a Raspberry Pi USB port. This was because I was a) familiar with the Arduino, b) not familiar with the Raspberry Pi GPIO, and c) thought it would make testing and debugging a bit easier, since I could just plug the Arduino into my laptop.\\n\\nHowever, it turns out that my Raspberry Pi had some issues with the arduino's FTDI chip if the Raspberry Pi was turned on while the Arduino was plugged in. It wouldn't recognize the Arduino until I unplugged it, and then plugged it back in again.\\n\\nSo I decided to make an Arduino Nano =&gt; Raspberry Pi GPIO adapter, and port my Arduino code to the Raspberry Pi GPIO using the [WiringPi](https://wiringpi.com/) library.\\n\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/arduino_raspberry_adapter.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/arduino_raspberry_adapter-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Arduino to Raspberry Pi adapter\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/raspberry_adapter_top.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/raspberry_adapter_top-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Arduino to Raspberry Pi adapter\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/raspberry_adapter_bottom.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/raspberry_adapter_bottom-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Arduino to Raspberry Pi adapter\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/raspberry_adapter_connected.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/raspberry_adapter_connected-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Arduino to Raspberry Pi adapter\\\" />\\n</a>\\n\\nThe Raspberry Pi is powered by a USB hub, which is also plugged into the Raspberry Pi's USB port. To power the hub, I wired up a power adapter to the microwave's power source. There's also a USB powered speaker, USB microphone, wifi adapter, and barcode scanner.\\n\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/power_adapter.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/power_adapter-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Power adapter\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/usb_hub.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/usb_hub-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"USB Hub\\\" />\\n</a>\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/microphone_wifi.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/microphone_wifi-resized-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Microphone + Wifi\\\" />\\n</a>\\n\\n# Microwave Software\\n\\nAll the software running on the Raspberry Pi is hosted at: [https://github.com/ndbroadbent/raspberry_picrowave](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/raspberry_picrowave).\\n\\nThere are 4 main components:\\n\\n## Microwave Daemon\\n\\nThis runs the code that listens for touchpad button presses, and controls the microwave. It also accepts TCP connections so that other programs can send commands or request information about the microwave's status.\\n\\n## Barcode Instructions\\n\\nThis program listens to the barcode scanner, and requests product information from the Microwave Cooking Database. It also runs the cooking programs.\\n\\n## Voice Control\\n\\nI used [PocketSphinx](https://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/) for voice recognition, which worked very well with my small [corpus](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/raspberry_picrowave/blob/master/voice_control/corpus.txt). I embedded Ruby in the [pocketsphinx_contiunous](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/raspberry_picrowave/blob/master/voice_control/pocketsphinx_microwave.c) C program, so that it would be easier to [script voice commands](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/raspberry_picrowave/blob/master/voice_control/voice_control.rb) and send commands to the microwave daemon. It turns out that the acoustics of my kitchen seem to mess up the recognition, so it won't be used very often.\\n\\n## Sinatra App\\n\\nThere's a simple [sinatra web application](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/raspberry_picrowave/blob/master/sinatra_app/microwave_webapp.rb) that lets you control the microwave from your phone or computer. This may not be a big selling point. It uses a [JavaScript EventSource](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/raspberry_picrowave/blob/master/sinatra_app/public/application.js) to push updates to the browser, so you could have hundreds of users connected to your microwave at once.\\n\\nIf any barcodes are scanned that can't be found on the Microwave Cooking Database, this webpage will display the unknown barcodes and provide a link to add the new product.\\n\\n## Microwave Cooking Database\\n\\nI couldn't find any existing websites with a database of microwave cooking instructions, so I made one.\\n\\n<a class=\\\"image\\\" href=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/mwcdb.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2013/07/mwcdb-resized-post.png\\\" alt=\\\"Microwave Cooking Database\\\" />\\n</a>\\n\\n> UPDATE: It used to be live at https://www.microwavecookingdb.com/, but the domain has now expired. Sorry!\\n\\nIf cooking instructions are posted for a 1000W microwave, you can request the instructions for a 700W microwave, and the cooking times will be automatically adjusted.\\n\\nSo if you're also planning on making an internet connected microwave with a barcode scanner, please feel free to sign up and add some products.\\n\\n<!--\\n# Patents?\\n\\nNope, this is just a fun project.

Unity supports\\n[many other platforms](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/multiplatform).\\n\\nMaking a simple game was a great way to learn React Native, but it's not the best tool for the job.\\nHowever, people have started working on some game libraries for React Native, such as [react-game-kit](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-game-kit) and [react-native-game-engine](https://github.com/bberak/react-native-game-engine).\\n\\nIt's not the easiest way to make a game, but it's also not impossible.\\nThe built-in [Animated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html) library is great,\\nand I also used [react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable).\\nI used a library to [play sounds](https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound).\\nI wrote native code to integrate with iOS Game Center and Google Play Game Services.\\nI used libraries to integrate with [InApp Billing on Android](https://github.com/idehub/react-native-billing),\\nand [in-app purchases on iOS](https://github.com/chirag04/react-native-in-app-utils).\\nI also wrote native code for ads and in-app purchases on Windows.\\nThere's a RN library for [particle effects](https://github.com/greghe/react-native-particle-system)\\n(although you'd have to add support for Android),\\nand [react-game-kit](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-game-kit) provides a way to manage sprites and animations.\\n\\nI want to make some more simple 2D games, and I'm going to stick with React Native for now. I can fork SudoBlock and reuse a lot of the code that I've already written.\\n\\nIf your goal is to quickly build a cross-platform mobile game, then I'd recommend learning Godot or Unity.\\n\\n# Don't worry about supporting Windows\\n\\nThis is a no-brainer. No one uses Windows Phone and Microsoft have abandoned it.\\nI wanted to explore and learn new things, so I decided to do it anyway. I enjoyed the process\\nof installing Windows, working with Visual Studio, and writing some C#.\\nI also figured out how to write cross-platform npm scripts using [scripty](https://github.com/testdouble/scripty).\\n\\n[react-native-windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows) gives you a UWP app that can\\nrun on Windows Phone, tablets, desktop, Xbox One, HoloLens, and other Windows platforms. But:\\n\\n- Nobody uses Windows Phone.\\n- Mobile games don't usually make sense on an Xbox.\\n- If your game runs in a browser, then you probably don't need a desktop app.\\n\\n# React Native might be better than Electron for desktop applications\\n\\nWhen I was running SudoBlock as a Windows desktop application, I realized that\\nReact Native could be a better choice than [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).\\nElectron apps are notorious for being huge and using a lot of memory (e.g. Slack and Spotify.)\\nThey have to package and load an entire WebKit browser.\\nReact Native apps are much smaller and use far less memory, because they only need a JavaScript engine.\\nYou can also use responsive design, so that a single codebase works on desktop, mobile, and the web. The only problem is that [react-native-macos](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos)\\nis unmaintained and out of date, so it would be great if a company sponsored development.\\n\\n# You'll probably write some native code\\n\\nSome people are attracted to React Native because they've heard that you can write a mobile\\napp with only JavaScript. In practice, this is only true for extremely simple applications.\\nMost of your code will be written in JavaScript, but you'll probably have to write some native code.\\nAt the very least, you must be prepared to fix some bugs in third-party libraries.\\n\\nI started contributing to [react-native-admob](https://github.com/sbugert/react-native-admob), and [sent a pull request to allow multiple test devices](https://github.com/sbugert/react-native-admob/pull/90). That was my introduction to native code in React Native, and I had to work with JavaScript, Objective-C, and Java.\\n\\nI also did a lot of work on [react-native-blur](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-blur). When I first tried to use it, it was completely broken on Android, and there were lots of problems on iOS.\\nIt took a lot of work to get everything running. I could have just skipped the blur and used a darkened overlay, but I enjoyed the work and learned a lot.\\n\\nI also had to write native code to integrate with iOS Game Center and Google Play Game Services,\\nand for ads and in-app purchases on Windows. I also wrote a small library to manage vibrations and haptic feedback across iOS, Android, Windows, and the web (using the [Vibration API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Vibration_API).)\\n\\n# There will be bugs\\n\\nReact Native is pretty stable, but there's a lot of unmaintained libraries,\\nand most libraries don't have any tests. React Native is a bit like jQuery, in that it smooths over a lot of quirks and inconsistencies and provides a consistent API. But there's some tricky edge cases,\\nand I often had to read the React Native source code to figure out why something was happening.\\n\\nSome examples:\\n\\n- There was a bug with the [native animation driver for Android](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13530).\\n- There were crashes in the\\n  [react-native-sound](https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound) library.\\n- The [Android GC seemed to be clearing some memory that shouldn't have been cleared](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43470160/in-a-react-native-javascript-app-why-would-the-android-gc-behavior-change-if-i).\\n\\nAndroid was particularly unstable. Not just React Native, but Android itself.\\nI didn't have too many problems with iOS.\\n\\n# React Native vs. iOS / Swift\\n\\nI wrote an iOS app with Swift a few years ago, and I've actually had a much better experience with React Native.\\nWhen I was working with UIKit, I remember constantly fighting with things like layout, contraints, and font rendering. I uncovered some actual bugs, and found long threads on the Apple forums that were being ignored.\\nIt was really nice to let React Native handle all of the rendering. I had no rendering issues on iOS or Android,\\nand just a few problems that I fixed on Windows.\\n\\nSwift was also very unstable at the time, and Xcode upgrades took a lot of effort.\\nMy Obj-C code still compiles a year later on the latest version of Xcode. If I was using Swift,\\nI think it would take at least a day to upgrade to Swift 4.1 and update all of the third-party libraries.\\nI believe Swift is [more stable now](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABIStabilityManifesto.md), and I love the language, so I might start using it again on future projects.\\n\\nI had a lot of headaches with React Native, but it wasn't as bad as Swift v1 and UIKit.\\n\\n# Marketing is really hard\\n\\n- I tested Facebook ads with $50. I reached about ~7,000 people and got ~50 clicks. One person\\n  ended up buying the game for $2.99, so I made $2. You can't spend $50 to make $2.\\n\\n- I posted on Reddit a few times:\\n\\n  - [I posted on /r/iosgaming, which went ok](https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/6edh0l/free_299_to_remove_ads_sudoblock_i_made_a_new_and/)\\n  - [I also tried a different tactic, which worked pretty well](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/6ecos4/after_seeing_all_your_posts_about_bug_fixes_and/)\\n\\n- A German website\\n  [published an article about SudoBlock](https://www.mobiflip.de/sudoblock-ist-eine-interessante-mischung-aus-tetris-und-sudoku/).\\n\\n- I tried to capitalize on [#covfefe](https://twitter.com/SudoBlock/status/870202842182590465),\\n  which didn't work at all. But I repurposed that new code into an [Emojidoku mode](https://twitter.com/SudoBlock/status/875065979679645696).\\n\\n- I found a game publisher who was going to handle all the marketing and split the revenue.\\n  They even promised to get the game featured on the App Store.\\n  We signed the contract and I took the apps down for a while, but the publisher fell off the radar and stopped replying to my emails.\\n\\n- I finally got around to writing this blog post.\\n\\n# Other Notes\\n\\n- I switched from Sublime Text to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) near the beginning of the project.\\n  VS Code is awesome. It's super fast and very customizable.\\n\\n- I set up [Flow](https://flow.org/) and started using [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).\\n  I love having static type checking for JavaScript.\\n\\n- I used Airbnb's [eslint config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), and spent about a day\\n  fixing all the issues. Every time I saw a rule that I didn't understand, I looked it up to understand their reasoning. I read through a lot of great discussions on Github. This was a great way to learn more about\\n  JavaScript, and especially some of the new ES6 features.\\n\\n- I starting doing some functional programming with [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide) and [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda). I had fun refactoring some code in a more functional style.\\n\\n- I really enjoyed working with [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga), which helped me clean up a lot of messy code.\\n\\n- I learned a lot about Reactive programming. This post is amazing: [The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754). I started playing with [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and\\n  [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable).\\n\\n- I set up [CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/), so that I could push JS changes without releasing a new version to the App Store. [The setup guide is very helpful.](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/README.md)\\n\\n- I had to debug some memory issues on Android, and this article was really helpful: [React Native Android App Memory Investigation](https://shift.infinite.red/react-native-android-app-memory-investigation-55695625da9c)\\n\\n- I learned about the [webpack DLL plugin](https://medium.com/@soederpop/webpack-plugins-been-we-been-keepin-on-the-dll-cdfdd6cb8cd7), which made development a lot faster. You can compile everything in `node_modules` as a separate bundle. You only need to do that once, so it saves a lot of time.\\n\\n- I released a boilerplate project with my [webpack config for react-native-web](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/react-native-web-webpack).\\n\\n- I learned about the [Babel AST](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types/commit/18edb329aa4fe7ebfd91af6d4b325cf9204e2ae1) while working on [an issue](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types/issues/95) in a Babel plugin, related to react-native-web.\\n\\n- I wrote a script that stripped unused glyphs from icon fonts, to reduce the app size.\\n\\n- I tested the app while simulating a slow network connection in Chrome. This revealed a bug where the counter started ticking before everything had finished loading.\\n\\n- I discovered that it takes a huge amount of effort to actually launch a game. Once I had a playable game, it was another 2 months before everything else was finished. Things like in-app purchases, ads, analytics, high scores, achievements, tutorials, app store listings, screenshots, icons, social media accounts, etc.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\nThis was about 3 months of work, and I was in a [state of flow](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>) most of the time. I learned a lot of new things, and I really enjoyed the whole process.\\nThe game has only made about $50 so far, but I have some more ideas for grid-based games, and\\nI can reuse a lot of the SudoBlock code. I'm also a freelancer, so this is the only way I can pick up new skills.\\n\\nThanks for reading!

        "mobiledoc": "{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\nI haven't written any blog posts for a while. One reason is that I've been hard at work on [DocSpring](https://docspring.com) for the last few years, and I haven't had a lot of time to work on personal projects. But the main reason is that my blog uses an older version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a \\\"static site generator\\\" [^1].\\n\\nI switched from Jekyll to Hugo in 2017, and the current version of Hugo at the time was [`0.21`](https://gohugo.io/news/0.21-relnotes/). I found a cool theme called [hugo-sustain](https://github.com/suyundukov/hugo-sustain). Everything was great for a few years.\\n\\nTime passed. One day, I tried to update a post or write a new post (I can't remember which.) I realized that my `build` and `develop` scripts were broken. I was a new computer at that point, and I had updated my macOS version. I installed the latest version of `hugo` and saw a bunch of interesting and confusing error messages when it tried to compile my old themes and layouts. I tried to downgrade `hugo` to version `0.21`, and it crashed with a segfault (it was built for an older version of macOS.) I cloned the `hugo` repository and tried to compile it from source, but my Go version was too new, so it failed to compile. Finally, I downgraded my Go version to an older version that was released around the same time in 2017. I held my breath as I tried to compile `hugo` one last time. Go tried to fetch all of the required dependencies, and crashed with a bunch of 404 errors. Apparently some of the packages had been renamed and moved around, and the older versions had been removed from the Go package index.\\n\\nSo I gave up for a while. Instead of generating my blog from the source, I switched to editing the static files directly. Sometimes I would need to correct a typo or adjust some styles, so I'd go into the generated `./public` directory and manually modify the raw HTML and CSS.\\n\\nTime passed. One day, I started to notice some activity on [a blog post that I had written 11 years ago](/2010/05/13/scanning-lots-of-photos-at-once/). This post is about a GIMP plugin called `deskew` that makes it easy to scan old photos in batches on a scanner and automatically rotate them. I had dropped this plugin file in my Google Drive and had pasted a link to the file. The link worked great for 10 years, and people were able to download the file without any issues. But eventually Google changed something and the link was no longer working. I started to receive emails from people who were requesting access to this file.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2021/12/request-to-access-deskew.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"Request to access the deskew file\\\" />\\n\\nI manually shared the file a few times. Then I decided to download the file and check it in to the blog repo. I started going into the `./public` directly to update the HTML, but I decided it was time to have another crack at this Hugo problem and fix my blog.\\n\\nShould I switch to Ghost? I've loved using Ghost for the [DocSpring blog](https://docspring.com/blog). It's a really nice blogging platform that I self-host on [Digital Ocean for $5/mo](https://www.digitalocean.com/), and I enjoy the WYSIWYG writing experience a little more than editing plain Markdown files. (Images are a bit annoying.) But I didn't want to migrate all my posts over to [ghost.org](https://ghost.org/) and get locked in, or spend $5/mo for the rest of my life. I just want some static HTML/CSS that I can put on GitHub Pages forever.\\n\\nShould I upgrade to the latest version of Hugo and spend hours fixing up the themes and tweaking all my posts until everything is working again? No thanks. Hugo runs on my local machine and produces static HTML and CSS content. It's a [pure function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pure_function). There are no security vulnerabilities to watch out for. As far as I'm concerned, Hugo version `0.21` is \\\"finished software.\\\" It generates my blog, and I'm happy with my blog. I will continue to be happy with my blog for many years to come. I don't need the latest and greatest features. I just want something stable that I can use over the next few decades without the constant grind of updating packages, breaking things, and debugging random issues. Give me Hugo `0.21` from May 2017!\\n\\nI was even tempted to throw everything away and start from scratch with something old and stable. Preferably written in Bash, C, or Perl. There's a lot of cool new languages out there but they often \\\"move fast and break things.\\\" The POSIX standard was created 33 years ago in 1988, so I could still run some shell scripts that are over 30 years old. (I asked Hacker News for some examples: [Ask HN: What is the oldest Posix script that I can still run in a modern shell?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29446380).)\\n\\nI had a sudden burst of inspiration:\\n\\n# Docker!\\n\\nI could run Hugo in a Docker image! If I can get Hugo `0.21` running in a Docker image, then I can save that Docker image into a `*.tar.gz` file and store it right in my git repo. Then I have a static `hugo` binary that comes packaged with everything it needs to run in a consistent environment, and I can run it anywhere (Linux, Mac OS, Windows.)\\n\\nI found a [Dockerfile in this docker-alpine-hugo repo](https://github.com/jonathanbp/docker-alpine-hugo/blob/master/Dockerfile), and I just needed to change `0.55.3` to `0.21`. Everything worked on the first try! [^2]\\n\\n### How I use Docker\\n\\nInstead of running `hugo`, I run a `./hugo` wrapper script that runs `hugo` inside a Docker container:\\n\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\ndocker run --rm -v \\\"${PWD}:/src\\\" hugo-alpine hugo \\\"$@\\\"\\n```\\n\\nI have a `build_docker` script [^3] that builds the Docker image and saves it to `hugo-alpine.tar.gz`:\\n\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\nset -euo pipefail\\n\\necho \\\"Building Dockerfile...\\\"\\ndocker build . -t hugo-alpine\\necho \\\"Saving image to hugo-alpine.tar.gz\\\"\\ndocker save hugo-alpine > hugo-alpine.tar.gz\\n```\\n\\nIf I'm on a new computer, I can just run `docker load -i hugo-alpine.tar.gz` to load the `hugo-alpine` image into Docker.\\n\\nI have a `dev` script that starts the `hugo` server and makes it available on port `1313`:\\n\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\ndocker run --rm -v \\\"${PWD}:/src\\\" -p 1313:1313 hugo-alpine hugo --watch serve --bind 0.0.0.0\\n```\\n\\nFinally, I have a `deploy` script that generates the static site into `./public`, then pushes the result to a `gh-pages` branch:\\n\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\nset -euo pipefail\\n\\nif [ ! -d public/.git ]; then\\n  rm -rf public\\n  REMOTE=\\\"$(git remote get-url origin)\\\"\\n  git clone \\\"${REMOTE}\\\" public\\n  (cd public && git checkout gh-pages)\\nfi\\n\\ndocker run --rm -v \\\"${PWD}:/src\\\" hugo-alpine hugo\\n\\ncd public\\ngit add -A\\ngit commit -m \\\"$(date)\\\"\\necho \\\"Pushing build...\\\"\\ngit push\\n\\ncd ..\\necho \\\"Pushing source...\\\"\\ngit push\\n```\\n\\n### You can view the source code for my blog here: https://github.com/ndbroadbent/ndbroadbent.github.io\\n\\n---\\n\\nI'm very happy with this workaround. Now I'm back in business, and I can update or write new blog posts to my heart's content. This new Docker-based setup should last me for the next few decades, if not longer. I still love how Hugo is super fast and generates my entire blog in about 6 seconds (even version `0.21`!) I'm in no hurry to switch to anything else.\\n\\n[^1]: A [static site generator](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) converts a folder full of Markdown files into a plain HTML/CSS website that you can host for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).\\n[^2]: I think it's generally much easier to get older Linux packages running, especially when it's a single Go binary with no dependencies. I wish it was this easy on Mac!\\n[^3]: Hopefully I never have to run this again!\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

        "mobiledoc": "{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n> I originally [posted this write-up on the Home Assistant Community Forums](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/i-automated-the-rangehood-above-my-stove-kitchen-extractor-fan-and-light-and-learned-a-lot/458085). I thought I would post it here as well, since I haven't written anything on this blog for a while. I've been getting more serious about Home Automation lately, so I might start writing some more blog posts and making a few videos.\\n\\nI figured out how to control the light and fan in the rangehood above my stove. I learned a lot from this project, and I wanted to share some of my experiences.\\n\\n- I figured out how to read the state of 4 buttons and light up 4 LEDs with only 5 wires\\n- I discovered some powerful circuit simulation software\\n- I used optocouplers for the first time (instead of relays)\\n- I wrote some C++ code for a custom ESPHome component\\n- I bought an oscilloscope\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nI wanted to be able to control the light and extractor fan above my stovetop, so I decided to automate it using an ESP32. This would be a similar concept to the [Raspberry Pi Microwave project](https://madebynathan.com/2013/07/10/raspberry-pi-powered-microwave/) that I built many years ago: I would put a \\\"proxy\\\" circuit between the buttons and the main board that controls the light and fan. The circuit would simulate button presses to control the main board, and it would read the state of the original buttons so that they would still work normally. The circuit would add WiFi connectivity so that the buttons could be controlled remotely and via automations in Home Assistant.\\n\\nI still use Raspberry Pis, but now I prefer using ESP32 and ESP8266 chips. ESPHome makes it so much easier to build little devices like this, and the OTA (over-the-air) updates are really convenient. I love all the built-in components that you can easily add to your YAML configuration files.\\n\\nHere's a photo of the rangehood, with some of my tools. You can see the main controller board and the button board hanging out.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/rangehood.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Picture of my kitchen rangehood\\\" />\\n\\nThis is the button board, which has 4 buttons, and an LED for each button:\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/button_led_board.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Button and LED board to control the rangehood\\\" />\\n\\n## How to read 4 buttons and light 4 LEDs with only 5 wires\\n\\nI wanted to preserve the original functionality of the rangehood buttons, so that you wouldn't even know there's an ESP32 chip inside. This button board was the first obstacle. If there were only 4 buttons, then that would be quite easy. You can just attach them directly to GPIO pins with an internal pull-up resistor. The LEDs were a bit confusing at first, but it was a fun puzzle to solve.\\n\\nI took a photo of the PCB and traced it using different colors, so I could where each of the wires was going:\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/pcb_traces.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"I traced the PCB on my phone\\\" />\\n\\nI found that button has a 1K ohm resistor, and each LED has a 148 ohm resistor.\\n\\n## Circuit simulation software\\n\\nI'm a software developer, so I really like having fast feedback loops and the ability to try lots of ideas quickly to see if something works. I started wondering if it might be possible to do this with circuits. I wanted to see if I could figure this out with trial and error and use some kind of circuit simulation software.\\n\\nI found [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), and my mind was blown! Now I had a virtual Arduino wired up to a virtual breadboard. I recreated this button/LED board inside TinkerCad. I could set up virtual multi-meters to see how much current was flowing through LEDs, and easily figure out values for resistors.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/tinkercad_simulation.png\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of TinkerCad simulation\\\" />\\n\\nThis is so awesome! It even tells you when too much current is going through an LED:\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/tinkercad_led_warning.png\\\" alt=\\\"It tells you when you have too much current going through an LED\\\" />\\n\\nHere's [a link to my TinkerCad project where you can run the circuit simulation](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1bAouc9AybL-rangehood-esp32-buttonled-proxy/editel?sharecode=78vrKEWsZrrcoPSy2SCQuQP9ZW9wdGJ0-cJg6wy4u84).\\n\\nI started playing around with some code in an Arduino sketch. I figured out how to light up the LEDs. I figured out how to read the buttons. But I couldn't figure out how to do them both at the same time. If I wanted to light up the LEDs, then I'd need to be using `3.3V` on the shared wire. But if I wanted to read the buttons, then the shared wire needed to be connected to `GND`.\\n\\nThen I finally had a breakthrough. Whenever I had worked with GPIO pins in the past, I had just assumed that \\\"high\\\" and \\\"low\\\" meant \\\"on\\\" and \\\"off\\\". But I realized that \\\"high\\\" literally just means `5V` (or `3.3V`), and \\\"low\\\" literally just means `GND`. So you can just change the direction of a circuit if you set your output pins to normally \\\"high\\\", and you swap the `GND` pin with a `3.3V` pin.\\n\\nSo instead of needing to choose between the `3.3V` pin and the `GND` pin, I could use a GPIO pin on the shared wire and toggle it between \\\"high\\\" and \\\"low\\\". I set it to \\\"low\\\" whenever I needed to read the buttons, and set it to \\\"high\\\" whenever I needed to light up the LEDs.\\n\\nI got something working in my virtual Arduino. The other side of the circuit was quite easy (to simulate the button presses.) I used some optocouplers as relays, where you send current through an IR LED and it turns on a transistor on the other side, but it keeps both of the circuits separated. Later on I realized that I should have been looking at \\\"solid state relays\\\", which are optocouplers that are specifically designed for this purpose and can switch much higher voltages and currents.\\n\\nI tried it out with a real Arduino, and it worked!\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/arduino_screenshot.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of Arduino logs in real life\\\" />\\n\\nIt was a pretty cool experience to simulate a whole Arduino circuit inside my browser, and then see it work in real life.\\n\\nhttps://everycircuit.com is also a really cool option for circuit simulation:\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/everycircuit.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"EveryCircuit.com simulation\\\" />\\n\\nIt can handle some things that TinkerCad can't do, such as astable multivibrator circuits where you need to inject a little noise to get it started. (TinkerCad just crashes with an \\\"infinite loop\\\" error.)\\n\\n## Custom C++ ESPHome Component\\n\\nAlright, on to the next step. I've got something working with an Arduino, but how do I port this to ESPHome and get it working over WiFI?\\n\\nI needed to set an GPIO pin to output mode for a while, briefly switch it to input mode, read the state of a button, and then set it back to output mode again. I couldn't figure out how to do this in a YAML configuration file for ESPHome, so I decided to write a custom component using C++.\\n\\nThe [ESPHome documentation is pretty good](https://esphome.io/custom/custom_component.html), and I was able to get something working. Here's my YAML configuration and my custom C++ module: https://gist.github.com/ndbroadbent/63aa5f105e21631bee4ff9a62c9b1608\\n\\nThe most important difference between Arduino and ESPHome is that a component's `loop()` function is only called once every 16 milliseconds. (Arduino restarts the loop instantly.) This was actually perfect for me, since it meant that I could read the buttons once every 16ms, and leave the LEDs on before I exit the loop.\\n\\n## I ran out of pins on my ESP8266 (Wemos D1 Mini)\\n\\nI should have made sure that everything worked on a breadboard. Instead, I started to get a bit impatient, and I jumped straight to soldering a prototype PCB. I soldering some pin headers for my ESP8266 development board, and then started with one input, and one optocoupler for the output. I tested it and it was all working, so I kept going.\\n\\nThen I checked the [ESP8266 pinout](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/) and realized that I had run out of GPIO pins.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/esp8266_pinout.png\\\" alt=\\\"ESP8266 pin out\\\" />\\n\\nI tried to get away with using some of the yellow \\\"OK\\\" ones, but the boot started failing (I guess I was pulling some of the pins high or low.) I needed 4 pins to control the optocoupler outputs, and 5 for the button/LED board. That's 9 GPIO pins, and the ESP8266 only had 7. I thought it had more!\\n\\nThis can be solved with shift registers. You only need 3 GPIO pins to [control a 74HC595 8-bit shift register](https://lastminuteengineers.com/74hc595-shift-register-arduino-tutorial/) and get 8 digital outputs. You only need one additional GPIO pin if you want to [add a CD4021BE shift register](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations/ShiftIn) (parallel-in, serial-out) and get 8 digital inputs. This is because the input and output registers can share the same clock and latch pins. You can then daisy-chain both of these to get as many inputs and outputs as you need (or use bigger shift registers with more pins), and use only 4 GPIO pins.\\n\\nAnyway, I switched to using an ESP32 development board which has 18 usable GPIO pins, and a few more with caveats. I used breadboard jumper wires to wire it up.\\n\\n## My resistors were too big\\n\\nI had put 1k resistors on the optocoupler outputs, to mimic the original button/LED board. What I didn't realize is that the optocoupler itself seemed to add about 500 ohms of resistance, so the resistance was slightly too high, and the rangehood controller board couldn't reliably read the simulated button presses.\\n\\nSo I unsoldered them and switched to 560 ohm resistors. Should have tested on a breadboard.\\n\\n## I bought a USB oscilloscope\\n\\nAfter doing a bunch of unsoldering and resoldering, putting random hookup wires all over the place, and swapping out ESP dev boards, I ended up with the ugliest prototype PCB you've ever seen. Of couse, stuff started breaking and one of my outputs wasn't working properly or reliably. It seemed like there was a problem with one of my optocouplers, and it was a real pain to figure out what was broken since I had only had a multimeter.\\n\\nI realized that a oscilloscope would be really useful, and I should have bought one a long time ago. I bought a [USB BitScope 10](http://my.bitscope.com/store/?p=view&i=item+3). It's pretty cool!\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/bitscope_screenshot.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of the Bitscope software on Mac\\\" />\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/components_on_desk.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Photo of breadboard and Bitscope on my desk\\\" />\\n\\nThis helped me figure out where some things needed to be resoldered. One of the optocouplers was only working when I pushed on it with my finger. I originally thought it might have been a broken chip or something to do with capacitance, but it was just a broken PCB trace and some dodgy soldering.\\n\\nI'm still learning how to use the BitScope software and have barely scratched the surface of what it can do. This is going to be extremely useful for future projects, especially for reverse engineering how stuff works. (P.S. You'll need their [pre-release version for the latest version of Mac OS](https://support.bitscope.com/X37HPRRV/#downloads).)\\n\\n## WiFi was very weak on my \\\"Duinotech Wearable ESP32 Development Board\\\"\\n\\nI initially switched to a [Duinotech Wearable ESP32 Development Board](https://www.jaycar.co.nz/duinotech-wearable-esp32-development-board/p/XC3810) that I had bought a while ago. I got everything working, but then it really struggled to connect to WiFi and would cut out regularly, and my entities would become unavailable. Even though I had a Ubiquity access point only 10 meters away in the same room.\\n\\nI found a few other people who seemed to have problems with WiFi as well, but they might be for different reasons:\\n\\n- https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=16311\\n- https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=11550&p=63020\\n- https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=18159\\n- https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=16622\\n- https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=6073\\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/esp32/comments/bbjrir/very_poor_wifi_performance/\\n\\nThen I found [the \\\"WiFi Power Save Mode\\\" section in the ESPHome documentation](https://esphome.io/components/wifi.html#wifi-power-save-mode):\\n\\n- `NONE` (least power saving, Default for ESP8266)\\n- `LIGHT` (Default for ESP32)\\n\\nSo I tried:\\n\\n```\\nwifi:\\n  power_save_mode: none\\n  output_power: 20\\n```\\n\\nI think this seemed to help a little bit, but it still wasn't very reliable. I had ordered some more electronics stuff and threw in another [ESP32 Development Board](https://surplustronics.co.nz/products/9368-esp32-development-board-38-pin-espwroom-32s). I tried this out once it arrived and it was an instant improvement. I just threw away the board with poor WiFi. I also ordered a bunch of shift registers so I can get back to using ESP8266 boards (adafruit huzzuh feathers), and they seem to have much better WiFi as well.\\n\\nI also ordered a few extra Wemos D1 Mini Pros that support external antennas. They haven't arrived yet, but I might try these out for car presence detection. I've been struggling with WiFi range for this as well.\\n\\n## Putting it all together\\n\\nI put everything into a little black box. Connected all the wires up and stuck it inside the rangehood. I chopped the power cable for the rangehood and added a screw terminal, and wired up a USB charger to power the ESP32 board.\\n\\nSo now I've got the fan and light in Home Assistant. (And the physical buttons still work as well.)\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/homeassistant_rangehood_screenshot.png\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of the rangehood entities in Home Assistant\\\" />\\n\\nI've set up an [entity controller](https://danobot.github.io/ec-docs/) to turn on the light.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nThe rangehood controller board has a piezo buzzer that beeps every time a button is pressed. That's pretty annoying. I might try to [desolder or destroy the buzzer](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/41806/how-do-you-remove-the-buzzer-from-this-pcb-whose-solder-side-is-inaccessible).\\n\\nI want to put an air quality sensor in the kitchen and automatically turn on the extractor fan based on AQI. I've ordered some [ZigBee air quality meters](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003797614144.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.0.0.5510f19c1mjFfW) on AliExpress, and they should arrive in a few weeks.\\n\\n> Update from Sep 30, 2022: I've put the air quality sensor in the kitchen, and have set it up to turn on the rangehood fan when the PM 2.5 level is above 12 µg/m³. (It usually hovers around 6 µg/m³.) It's been working really well!\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/kitchen_aqi_chart.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Chart of PM 2.5 levels in our kitchen. I use a filter to remove outliers and smooth out the data.\\\" />\\n\\nI also bought a current clamp sensor that can measure AC current. I want to set this up for the stovetop so I can detect when it's on and automatically turn on the fan (in advance, instead of waiting for the AQI to get bad.) It would be easier if I could use an energy monitoring wall plug, but it looks like the stovetop is wired directly into the circuit breaker, and it uses a lot of power so I don't want to mess around with those wires. I'll just separate them and put a clamp around one of them. I'll follow [this guide to set it all up](https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/electricity-monitoring/ct-sensors/interface-with-arduino?redirected=true) and get it working on an ESP32.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/09/ac_current_clamp_circuit.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Circuit diagram for measuring AC current with a clamp sensor\\\" />\\n\\nI have [this power meter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32695813719.html?spm=a2g0s.12269583.0.0.197e6455U2UxlV) that I'll use to calibrate it.\\n\\nI also want to learn how to make a proper PCB design in KiCad and order a [cool purple PCB from OSH park](https://oshpark.com/).\\n\\nI'm really enjoying this self-directed crash course in electronics. It's really fun to learn so much while working on practical projects that we can use every day in our house.\\n\\nThanks for reading, it was fun to write up everything I learned.

This means that you can physically plug a SATA drive into a SAS connector, but you can't plug a SAS drive into a SATA controller (because it won't fit.) SAS controller software can support SATA drives, but SATA controllers don't support SAS drives (even if you have an adapter.)\\n\\n## Why do I have a SAS controller?\\n\\nI was running [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/) on a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). I kept adding more and more Home Assistant add-ons (which run in Docker containers), so it started to get a bit slow. It took a long time to restart Home Assistant, and we started to notice some speed and reliability issues.\\n\\nI already had a server rack in my closet, so I wanted to get a proper server to put in it. I didn't need anything too fancy. It just needed to be a little bit faster than a Raspberry Pi, so I found a 10 year old IBM server for $249 NZD ($160 USD.) I found it on TradeMe, which is similar to eBay in New Zealand.\\n\\n- Model: [IBM System X3250 M4 E3-1270v2](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/overview-ibm-system-x3250-m4-windows-server-2012-type-2583)\\n- CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1270v2 4-core, 8-thread Processor\\n- Memory: 8GB DDR3 Ram\\n- Storage: 4x 2.5\\\" SAS / SATA drive bays, 1x 240GB SAS hard drive\\n- Controller: LSI SAS2004 IR SAS / SATA HBA\\n- Power: 2x 460w power supplies\\n\\nThe new server has been working great, and Home Assistant is noticeably faster. The 10-year-old Intel Xeon E3-1270v2 CPU has a CPU Mark benchmark score of 6429, which is 8x better than the Broadcom BCM2711 processor in a Raspberry Pi 4B (834.)\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/sata-sas/bcm2711-vs-intel-xeon.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"BCM2711 vs Intel Xeon E3-1270 V2\\\" />\\n\\n- [BCM2711 vs Intel Xeon E3-1270 V2 @ 3.50GHz on cpubenchmark.net](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/BCM2711-vs-Intel-Xeon-E3-1270-V2/4297vs1192)\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe only problem is that the server came with a 320GB SAS hard-drive. It was a bit too small, and it made a lot of clicking noises. I wanted to replace it with a 1TB SATA SSD, which would be faster and silent. I just wasn't sure if my old server would be compatible with a modern SATA SSD.\\n\\nI did a bit of research, and it seemed like it would work, so I bought a new Samsung 870 EVO 1TB SSD. It was the same size and had the same screw holes as the old 2.5\\\" SAS drive, so I was able to swap the drives and use the same drive bracket. I put in the new drive and installed Debian 11 (with LVM), and everything worked great!\\n\\n**Conclusion: The latest Samsung SATA SSDs are still compatible with SAS controllers in servers that were made in 2012.**\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}",

They are used to limit the current flowing through a circuit. Resistors have colored bands that represent their value. The first two bands represent the first two digits of the resistance, and the third band represents the \\\"multiplier\\\" value, or power of 10. For example, a 10KΩ resistor has a brown band, a black band, and an orange band. The first two bands are brown (1) and black (0), which is 10. The third band is orange (1,000Ω), so the resistance is 10 x 1,000 = 10,000Ω.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/e24-resistors-ring-binder/10k-resistor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"10,000 ohm resistor\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 500px;\\\" />\\n\\nThe \\\"tolerance\\\" value is the fourth band. This is the maximum deviation from the nominal resistance. For example, a 10KΩ resistor with a 5% tolerance can have a resistance between 9,500Ω and 10,500Ω.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/e24-resistors-ring-binder/resistor-color-chart.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Resistor color chart\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 500px;\\\" />\\n\\n## The E24 Series\\n\\nThe [E24 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_series_of_preferred_numbers) is a logarithmic series of 24 values for each power of 10: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.7, 3.0, 3.3, 3.6, 3.9, 4.3, 4.7, 5.1, 5.6, 6.2, 6.8, 7.5, 8.2, 9.1.\\n\\nYou can multiply each value in the series by the multiplier (power of 10) to get the 24 resistance values for each order of magnitude. For example, these are the first ten resistor values with a brown multiplier band (10Ω): 100Ω, 110Ω, 120Ω, 130Ω, 150Ω, 160Ω, 180Ω, 200Ω, 220Ω, 240Ω.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# How I Organized 1,700 Resistors\\n\\nI bought a resistor pack that included 1,700 resistors in the E24 series, in sets of 10 (170 different values.) I bought 1/4 W carbon film resistors with a 5% tolerance.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/e24-resistors-ring-binder/resistor-kit.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Pack of carbon film resistors\\\" />\\n\\nIt's very useful to have a wide range of resistors for breadboard circuits and prototype PCBs. It's not so useful when they're all mixed together in a single bag. The resistors I bought didn't have any labels or markings on the paper strips, so I had to read the colored bands or use a multimeter to find the resistance.\\n\\nFor my first attempt at organizing them, I sorted them by the multiplier band (0.1Ω, 1Ω, 10Ω, etc.), and put them in labeled drawers:\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/e24-resistors-ring-binder/original-labeled-drawers.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"The original drawers I used to organize the resistors\\\" />\\n\\nThis didn't really help at all. I still needed to sort through 24 different values to find the one I was looking for. It got even worse once I started pulling out individual resistors to use in breadboard circuits. Instead of 24 sets of 10, I could have up to 240 individual resistors to sort through.\\n\\n## Ring Binder Design\\n\\nI had some spare card sleeves, and I realized that I could use these to create a 3x3 grid of pockets on an A4 ring binder sheet.\\n\\nI used [DocSpring](https://docspring.com) to create the layout for all the pages. DocSpring is an API for filling out and generating PDFs. You can upload an existing PDF form, or create your own PDF templates using HTML and CSS. DocSpring's HTML/CSS templates support the [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), so I wrote some Liquid code to calculate the resistor values and generate all the pages for the E24 series.\\n\\n> (Disclaimer: I'm the founder of DocSpring.)\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/e24-resistors-ring-binder/docspring-template-html-screenshot.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of the DocSpring template editor showing Liquid / HTML\\\" />\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/e24-resistors-ring-binder/docspring-template-scss-screenshot.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of the DocSpring template editor showing SCSS\\\" />\\n\\n> This template didn't need any fields, so I didn't need to use the DocSpring API. I just downloaded the generated PDF from the Preview tab.\\n\\nI included a resistor graphic that shows the colored bands for each value. This was invaluable when I was sorting resistors into sleeves.\\n\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/e24-resistors-ring-binder/pdf-template-example.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of the DocSpring template editor showing SCSS\\\" />\\n\\nI used [Sleeve Kings 63.5mm X 88mm Card Sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/Sleeve-Kings-Card-Sleeves-63-5x88mm/dp/B07RD9QZD2?&linkCode=ll1&tag=ndbroadbent-20&linkId=b7ec66667342d933da70a72b98482f5f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) for the 3x3 grid of pockets.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Sleeve-Kings-Card-Sleeves-63-5x88mm/dp/B07RD9QZD2?&linkCode=ll1&tag=ndbroadbent-20&linkId=b7ec66667342d933da70a72b98482f5f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\\\">\\n<img class=\\\"lightbox thumb\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/posts/2022/10/e24-resistors-ring-binder/sleeve-kings-card-sleeves.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sleeve Kings 63.5mm X 88mm Card Sleeves\\\" />\\n</a>\\n\\nI cut them to make them a little shorter, and stuck them onto ring binder sheets using a glue stick. Then I sorted all the resistors into sleeves, which felt like doing a jigsaw puzzle. It was a fun activity for a rainy Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nI'm pretty happy with how this turned out, and I think my version is even better than the expensive ring binders I found for sale.
