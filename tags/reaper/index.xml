      <description>My Compaq Evo T20 running tinycore linux, playing shell.fm, displaying track info via lcd4linux on a Pertelian X2o40 USB LCD display.

 
Uses music software Reaper to play audio and generate MIDI events. Midi events are sent to the &#39;output&#39; of MIDI Yoke, which patches them to a software emulated MIDI input. Used the MIDIOX COM wrapper with Visual Basic, to monitor the MIDI Yoke input and trigger http downloads on certain MIDI note events.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a REAPER license for a year or 2 now. Get rid of Logic Pro and Protools, REAPER is the most awesome music creation software I have ever used. I love the unparalleled flexibility to make it do whatever you can imagine.
I just followed this extremely helpful tutorial by Dave Hayes  to get REAPER running on Ubuntu with wineasio. And now, I am in the middle of researching midi plugins that can trigger shell or network events.</description>
