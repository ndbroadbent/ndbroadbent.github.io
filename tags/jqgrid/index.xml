      <description>If you are using an older version of jqGrid because it comes nicely wrapped up in the jquery-grid-rails-plugin, keep in mind that all the demo code is written with the new API introduced in version 3.6. Fortunately, most of the demo code can still be reused with our version of jqGrid (3.5). Just get rid of any &amp;ldquo;jqGrid(&amp;rsquo; ** &amp;lsquo;)&amp;rdquo; function wrappers, and everything should work fine. (I find this easier to do than rewriting the rails plugin for the new version)</description>

      <description>Been a fan of jqgrid for quite some time, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking forward to the struggle of getting it to work with Rails.
Thankfully, someones already done it for me: http://www.2dconcept.com/jquery-grid-rails-plugin
It did take a little while to debug some things that were going wrong, though. Firebug was giving me the error: $.jgrid.formatter is undefined. After some digging around, I realized that no jqgrid locale files were being loaded.
By default, Spree has its i18n locale set to &amp;ldquo;en-US&amp;rdquo;.</description>
