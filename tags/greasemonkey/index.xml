      <description>I like Grooveshark. Its like last.fm, but you can choose the songs &amp;amp; albums you want to play. I would like to get a subscription one day, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when the RIAA is planning their attack, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll hold off for now :)
In the meantime, I was dissapointed that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see which song was currently playing in the browser title. So heres a greasemonkey script to do just that:</description>
