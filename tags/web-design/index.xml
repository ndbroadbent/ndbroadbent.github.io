      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a blog post about creating a favicon.ico file for your website or blog. Things have changed a bit since I wrote that blog post in May 2010.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating the CSS for my blog recently, and I wanted to update the favicon. Here&amp;rsquo;s the old green square icon that I was using before:

I didn&amp;rsquo;t like this one anymore and I wanted something a bit more interesting, so I wanted to see if I could use some of the new text-to-image AI tools that have been blowing up on the internet.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a tiny web application called &amp;lsquo;Avatar Harmony&amp;rsquo;.
You can sign in with twitter or facebook, add your Gravatar login details, and the app will automatically sync your profile pics across each of your accounts.
It can sync avatars in the following directions:
 Facebook =&amp;gt; Twitter Facebook =&amp;gt; Gravatar Twitter =&amp;gt; Gravatar Gravatar =&amp;gt; Twitter  Unfortunately, the Facebook Graph API doesn&#39;t let us update profile pics at the moment, but I&#39;ll keep looking around for a solution.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished most of the work I&amp;rsquo;m going to do on my shell.fm ruby server. Its written on sinatra + jquery + jquery-ui (so, a lot of ajax calls). It also requires my custom shell.fm fork if you want the volume control to work.
You can find my shell.fm fork here: http://github.com/ndbroadbent/shell-fm
and the shell.fm sinatra server is here: http://github.com/ndbroadbent/shell-fm_sinatra
By the way, this post is about an embedded linux system that plays last.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Theres an easier way to do this here: http://www.htmlcenter.com/blog/creating-a-favicon-for-your-website/.
http://linuxproblem.org/art_19.html
By Mathias Kettner :
You need an image file that GIMP can open (PNG, GIF, etc.). And you need the command line tool ppmtowinicon from the netpbm-tools (on SuSE you have to have installed the package netpbm). Now perform the following actions:
 Open your image with GIMP. If your image is not a square then resize the canvas with GIMP.</description>

      <title>obscure jqGrid API notes</title>

      <description>If you are using an older version of jqGrid because it comes nicely wrapped up in the jquery-grid-rails-plugin, keep in mind that all the demo code is written with the new API introduced in version 3.6. Fortunately, most of the demo code can still be reused with our version of jqGrid (3.5). Just get rid of any &amp;ldquo;jqGrid(&amp;rsquo; ** &amp;lsquo;)&amp;rdquo; function wrappers, and everything should work fine. (I find this easier to do than rewriting the rails plugin for the new version)</description>
