      <description>.blogpost h1 { font-size: 28px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 40px; }  I used React Native to build a cross-platform game for iOS, Android, Windows, and the web. SudoBlock is a cross between Sudoku, jigsaw puzzles, and Tetris.
You can find SudoBlock on the web, App Store, Google Play, and the Microsoft Store.

React Native only supports iOS and Android, but I used react-native-web for the browser, and react-native-windows for Windows desktop and phone.</description>
