      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a blog post about creating a favicon.ico file for your website or blog. Things have changed a bit since I wrote that blog post in May 2010.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating the CSS for my blog recently, and I wanted to update the favicon. Here&amp;rsquo;s the old green square icon that I was using before:

I didn&amp;rsquo;t like this one anymore and I wanted something a bit more interesting, so I wanted to see if I could use some of the new text-to-image AI tools that have been blowing up on the internet.</description>

      <description>I was inspired by a makezine.com article I was reading this evening, and decided to follow a tutorial to make an embossed box out of an aluminium can. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything creative for a long time, and I really enjoyed it.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if sanding the outside of the can is completely necessary, since its only visible on the inside of the box. Also, a ballpoint pen isn&amp;rsquo;t the best tool to use, since it leaves blue ink everywhere.</description>

You need an image file that GIMP can open (PNG, GIF, etc.). And you need the command line tool ppmtowinicon from the netpbm-tools (on SuSE you have to have installed the package netpbm). Now perform the following actions:
 Open your image with GIMP. If your image is not a square then resize the canvas with GIMP.</description>
