      <description>I found out about http://www.wimp.com last year, and have been watching their daily videos ever since. Its a simple website that offers 5 or 6 daily videos on a range of topics, such as science, comedy and innovation. And thats all there is. No bells and whistles, just a daily list of 5 videos. The videos are awesome, but I always wanted to watch them with google reader via rss.</description>

      <description>My Compaq Evo T20 running tinycore linux, playing shell.fm, displaying track info via lcd4linux on a Pertelian X2o40 USB LCD display.

 
Uses music software Reaper to play audio and generate MIDI events. Midi events are sent to the &#39;output&#39; of MIDI Yoke, which patches them to a software emulated MIDI input. Used the MIDIOX COM wrapper with Visual Basic, to monitor the MIDI Yoke input and trigger http downloads on certain MIDI note events.</description>
