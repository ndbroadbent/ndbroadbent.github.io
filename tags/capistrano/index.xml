      <description>capistrano_colors has been merged into capistrano. If you update capistrano to version 2.13.5, you will no longer need to include capistrano_colors in your Gemfile.Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to also remove require &#39;capistrano_colors&#39; from config/deploy.rb.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using capistrano without the capistrano_colors gem, well, you&amp;rsquo;ve been missing out! Your logs will now be nicely formatted and colored by default, like this:
However, if you happen to be a big fan of black &amp;amp; white logs, you can just add disable_log_formatters to config/deploy.</description>

      <description>Capistrano is a great tool, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine running a project without it. I always wanted a quick way to know exactly what was running on each of our servers, and needed to know what would would change when I ran &amp;lsquo;cap deploy&amp;rsquo;.
&amp;ldquo;cap deploy:pending&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cap deploy:pending:diff&amp;rdquo; already solve this problem a little bit, but I found them to be too verbose. Also, they don&amp;rsquo;t work so well as part of an automated deploy process since they can require user interaction.</description>
