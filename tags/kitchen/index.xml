      <description>I originally posted this write-up on the Home Assistant Community Forums. I thought I would post it here as well, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything on this blog for a while. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting more serious about Home Automation lately, so I might start writing some more blog posts and making a few videos.
 I figured out how to control the light and fan in the rangehood above my stove.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I was inspired by this post on Reddit, titled: Food items should have QR codes that instruct the microwave exactly what to do. Like high for 2 minutes, let stand 1 minute, medium 1 minutes..
I thought this was a pretty cool idea, and that it would be a fun project for a Raspberry Pi. I agreed with the people who thought using UPC barcodes would be better, since products already have them, so I went with a barcode scanner + online product database.</description>
