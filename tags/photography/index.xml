      <description>I needed a way to scan a lot of photos at once. I was going to write a GIMP plugin to extract out multiple images from a single scanned image of 3 or 4 photos, and then rotate them automatically. But as always, someone had already beat me to it :)
See this forum on GimpTalk for the original script.
(The only problem I had is that the Deskew plugin for GIMP is located on a website whose server seems to be permanently offline.</description>
