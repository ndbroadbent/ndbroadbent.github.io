      <description>Yahoo Pipes is fantastic. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of yahoo in the past, but their pipes service is amazing. Its great for sprucing up a not-so-well implemented RSS feed, and lets you create feeds from virtually anything on the web.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a daily Calvin and Hobbes RSS feed that parses the comic image from the linked page, and drops it in the feed itself. Perfect for Google Reader.</description>

      <description>I found out about http://www.wimp.com last year, and have been watching their daily videos ever since. Its a simple website that offers 5 or 6 daily videos on a range of topics, such as science, comedy and innovation. And thats all there is. No bells and whistles, just a daily list of 5 videos. The videos are awesome, but I always wanted to watch them with google reader via rss.</description>
