      <description>capistrano_colors has been merged into capistrano. If you update capistrano to version 2.13.5, you will no longer need to include capistrano_colors in your Gemfile.Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to also remove require &#39;capistrano_colors&#39; from config/deploy.rb.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using capistrano without the capistrano_colors gem, well, you&amp;rsquo;ve been missing out! Your logs will now be nicely formatted and colored by default, like this:
However, if you happen to be a big fan of black &amp;amp; white logs, you can just add disable_log_formatters to config/deploy.</description>

      <description>GitHub is a great way to manage code for an open source project, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any way to send a message to all of your watchers. This can be necessary whenever you make certain changes to your application. For example, I recently merged a pull request in Errbit that requires users to run a Rake task next time they update the code. I had no way of notifying our users, so I decided to create a Google Group mailing list for these kinds of notifications.</description>

      <title>Scheduling one-off tasks with &#39;at&#39;</title>

      <description>You might be familiar with the cron job scheduler, which is great for repeating tasks. But when you want to schedule a command to only run once in the future, the at command is what you are looking for.
In my case, I was updating a plugin for our Thoughtworks Mingle instance, but the update wasn&amp;rsquo;t hugely important. Many of our staff rely on Mingle for their work, and restarting it takes it offline for a few minutes.</description>
