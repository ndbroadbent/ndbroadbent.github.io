      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a REAPER license for a year or 2 now. Get rid of Logic Pro and Protools, REAPER is the most awesome music creation software I have ever used. I love the unparalleled flexibility to make it do whatever you can imagine.
I just followed this extremely helpful tutorial by Dave Hayes  to get REAPER running on Ubuntu with wineasio. And now, I am in the middle of researching midi plugins that can trigger shell or network events.</description>
