      <description>Plex-Cleaner is a Python script that can clean up your Plex directory by deleting movies and TV shows after you&amp;rsquo;ve watched them. This will stop your disk from filling up with lots of old media files over time. You can run this script on your server (or Raspberry Pi, or wherever you run Plex Media Server.)
I like to put things in the /opt directory on my servers.
 Run git clone https://github.</description>

      <description>Yes. SATA and SAS use very similar connectors, but a SATA connector has a gap in the middle. This means that you can physically plug a SATA drive into a SAS connector, but you can&amp;rsquo;t plug a SAS drive into a SATA controller (because it won&amp;rsquo;t fit.) SAS controller software can support SATA drives, but SATA controllers don&amp;rsquo;t support SAS drives (even if you have an adapter.)
Why do I have a SAS controller?</description>
