      <description>I used a ring binder and card sleeves to organize 1,700 through-hole resistors.

      <description>I originally posted this write-up on the Home Assistant Community Forums. I thought I would post it here as well, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything on this blog for a while. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting more serious about Home Automation lately, so I might start writing some more blog posts and making a few videos.
 I figured out how to control the light and fan in the rangehood above my stove.</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi Microwave</title>

      <description>A few months ago, I was inspired by this post on Reddit, titled: Food items should have QR codes that instruct the microwave exactly what to do. Like high for 2 minutes, let stand 1 minute, medium 1 minutes..
I thought this was a pretty cool idea, and that it would be a fun project for a Raspberry Pi. I agreed with the people who thought using UPC barcodes would be better, since products already have them, so I went with a barcode scanner + online product database.</description>

      <title>Repurposed pressure gauge - Bathroom door indicator</title>
      <link>https://madebynathan.com/2011/04/30/repurposed-pressure-gauge-as-bathroom-indicator/</link>

      <description>I turned an old brass pressure gauge into a vacant/engaged indicator for our bathroom. The needle is a hacked ammeter, and the metal slide lock on the other side of the door switches it on.
(Inspired by this analog bandwidth meter.)</description>

      <title>Weather Notifier</title>

      <description>This is just a little idea I had on the bus.
Outside my apartment, I have a bucket for umbrellas.
A program checks the local weather on weather.com from time to time. If there&#39;s any chance of rain, it switches on the lights installed in the bucket.
So when I walk out the door, I know whether or not I should take an umbrella to work.

      <description>My hall light turns on for 15 minutes if it&amp;rsquo;s past 10pm and I unlock my door with an octopus card or iPhone.

Its just a 12v relay (rated at 240V/30A), and some cat-5 to the thin client PC. All happens to fit perfectly inside the light switch.
Next up, automatic plant watering &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Octopus cards in Hong Kong can be used to purchase almost anything, such as groceries, McDonalds, and public transport. Since everyone has one, a lot of apartments are using them for access control.
One of my first projects after moving back to Hong Kong was installing an electronic lock on my apartment door. My door can be now be unlocked with an Octopus RFID card, iPhone app, or over the web.</description>
