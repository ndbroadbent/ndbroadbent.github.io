      <description>I used a ring binder and card sleeves to organize 1,700 through-hole resistors.

      <description>Plex-Cleaner is a Python script that can clean up your Plex directory by deleting movies and TV shows after you&amp;rsquo;ve watched them. This will stop your disk from filling up with lots of old media files over time. You can run this script on your server (or Raspberry Pi, or wherever you run Plex Media Server.)
I like to put things in the /opt directory on my servers.
 Run git clone https://github.</description>

      <title>Can you plug a SATA drive into a SAS controller?</title>
      <link>https://madebynathan.com/posts/2022-10-07-can-you-plug-a-sata-drive-into-a-sas-controller/</link>

      <guid>https://madebynathan.com/posts/2022-10-07-can-you-plug-a-sata-drive-into-a-sas-controller/</guid>
      <description>Yes. SATA and SAS use very similar connectors, but a SATA connector has a gap in the middle. This means that you can physically plug a SATA drive into a SAS connector, but you can&amp;rsquo;t plug a SAS drive into a SATA controller (because it won&amp;rsquo;t fit.) SAS controller software can support SATA drives, but SATA controllers don&amp;rsquo;t support SAS drives (even if you have an adapter.)
Why do I have a SAS controller?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a blog post about creating a favicon.ico file for your website or blog. Things have changed a bit since I wrote that blog post in May 2010.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating the CSS for my blog recently, and I wanted to update the favicon. Here&amp;rsquo;s the old green square icon that I was using before:

I wanted something a bit more interesting, so I tried using some of the new text-to-image AI tools that have been getting a lot of attention lately.</description>

      <description>I originally posted this write-up on the Home Assistant Community Forums. I thought I would post it here as well, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything on this blog for a while. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting more serious about Home Automation lately, so I might start writing some more blog posts and making a few videos.
 I figured out how to control the light and fan in the rangehood above my stove.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t written any blog posts for a while. One reason is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work on DocSpring for the last few years, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of time to work on personal projects. But the main reason is that my blog uses an older version of Hugo, which is a &amp;ldquo;static site generator&amp;rdquo; 1.
I switched from Jekyll to Hugo in 2017, and the current version of Hugo at the time was 0.</description>

      <title>What I Learned While Making a Game With React Native</title>

      <guid>https://madebynathan.com/posts/2018-02-12-what-i-learned-while-making-a-game-with-react-native/</guid>
      <description>I used React Native to build a cross-platform game for iOS, Android, Windows, and the web. SudoBlock is a cross between Sudoku, jigsaw puzzles, and Tetris.
You can find SudoBlock on the web, App Store, Google Play, and the Microsoft Store.

React Native only supports iOS and Android, but I used react-native-web for the browser, and react-native-windows for Windows desktop and phone. The UWP app can also run on Xbox One and HoloLens.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I was inspired by this post on Reddit, titled: Food items should have QR codes that instruct the microwave exactly what to do. Like high for 2 minutes, let stand 1 minute, medium 1 minutes..
I thought this was a pretty cool idea, and that it would be a fun project for a Raspberry Pi. I agreed with the people who thought using UPC barcodes would be better, since products already have them, so I went with a barcode scanner + online product database.</description>

      <description>Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m looking at backtraces, logs, or failing tests in the terminal, I often need to open one of those files in my text editor. It was previously a semi-arduous process that involved highlighting, copying, pasting and the return key. Now, all I need to do is double-click or highlight a line, and then press a keyboard shortcut to open that file &amp;amp; line in my text editor (currently Sublime Text 2.</description>

      <description>Note: This post is for people who use the terminal to run Rails generators. It probably won&amp;rsquo;t interest you if your editor has a plugin to run them. 
After running a Rails generator, you&amp;rsquo;ll often need to edit the generated files in your text editor.
Rails 4 may soon have the ability to open generated files in your text editor if you pass the --editor option on the command line.</description>

      <description>Every Rails developer has probably experienced the following error:
Could not find &amp;lt;gem&amp;gt; in any of the sources Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.   This happens if you or someone else adds a gem to your Gemfile, or if a gem version is updated in Gemfile.lock, and you forget to run bundle install before running a Rails command.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple function that handles this automatically, called bundle_install_wrapper().</description>

      <description>capistrano_colors has been merged into capistrano. If you update capistrano to version 2.13.5, you will no longer need to include capistrano_colors in your Gemfile.Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to also remove require &#39;capistrano_colors&#39; from config/deploy.rb.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using capistrano without the capistrano_colors gem, well, you&amp;rsquo;ve been missing out! Your logs will now be nicely formatted and colored by default, like this:
However, if you happen to be a big fan of black &amp;amp; white logs, you can just add disable_log_formatters to config/deploy.</description>

      <description>If you often make changes to your ~/.bashrc, you might be sick of typing source ~/.bashrc after every change. It can also be annoying when you switch to a different tab in your terminal, but your new aliases or functions aren&amp;rsquo;t available until you type source ~/.bashrc.
While I was working on scm_breeze and my dotfiles repo, I grew tired of having to type this command, so I aliased it to sbrc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m saving a little space in my terminal by replacing my username and group (ndbroadbent) with a single symbol. I&amp;rsquo;m doing this in my prompt, as well as in the output of ls commands:
(My laptop&amp;rsquo;s hostname is also represented by a symbol.)
For the ls output, it was a bit tricky to re-justify the username and group columns after substituting my username. I decided to do it in ruby, and then played some ruby golf:</description>

      <description>A day in the life of a Rails developer will usually involve a few git pulls, bundle installs, and switching between different projects. I thought it would be great if my projects could be automatically kept up-to-date, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend too much time updating code or installing new gems.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the whenever gem to create cron tasks that:
 Update all my git repos from their remotes Satisfy all of my Gemfile&amp;rsquo;s dependencies Cache rake and capistrano commands for tab completion Fetch Travis CI build statuses to show in my terminal Maintain an index of my git repos so I can quickly switch between projects, while keeping them organized  For all of these tasks, I&amp;rsquo;m using the git_index function provided by my SCM Breeze project.</description>

      <description>GitHub is a great way to manage code for an open source project, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any way to send a message to all of your watchers. This can be necessary whenever you make certain changes to your application. For example, I recently merged a pull request in Errbit that requires users to run a Rake task next time they update the code. I had no way of notifying our users, so I decided to create a Google Group mailing list for these kinds of notifications.</description>

      <description>Skype on Linux comes with it&amp;rsquo;s own notification system. It&amp;rsquo;s not that bad, but it&amp;rsquo;s not consistent, either. If you want to configure Skype to use libnotify instead, run the following script in your terminal:
(NOTE: You must have installed Skype, and logged in at least once.)
bash &amp;lt; &amp;lt;(curl -s https://raw.github.com/gist/2181122/skype-libnotify.sh)  This downloads and executes the script from this gist: https://gist.github.com/2181122
It fetches the skype configuration from here, which is part of my dotfiles repo.</description>

      <description>You might be familiar with the cron job scheduler, which is great for repeating tasks. But when you want to schedule a command to only run once in the future, the at command is what you are looking for.
In my case, I was updating a plugin for our Thoughtworks Mingle instance, but the update wasn&amp;rsquo;t hugely important. Many of our staff rely on Mingle for their work, and restarting it takes it offline for a few minutes.</description>

Travis CI is a distributed continuous integration service for the open source community, and it can be used with any of your public projects on GitHub. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen some &amp;lsquo;build status&amp;rsquo; badges like this:</description>

      <description>There was a post on the front page of Hacker News recently, titled &amp;ldquo;Making Chrome better on iOS&amp;rdquo;. Google&amp;rsquo;s Chrome browser is now available on iOS, and the author of the article was talking about how app developers could be persuaded to add some code to their apps which would allow Chrome to open links.
Restrictions like this (not being able to change your default browser) are one of the many reasons why I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t buy another iPhone if it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be jailbroken.</description>

      <description>SCM Breeze is a set of shell scripts (for bash and zsh) that make it easier to use git. It integrates with your shell to give you numbered file shortcuts, a repository index with tab completion, and a community driven collection of useful SCM functions.
Disclaimer: git is currently the only supported SCM. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept the project&amp;rsquo;s name open because it won&amp;rsquo;t be difficult to port it for other SCMs.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you just want to copy something from your terminal and paste it somewhere else. You might have heard of a Linux program called xclip, which provides a command line interface to X selections. However, xclip&amp;rsquo;s default selection isn&amp;rsquo;t the clipboard, and typing xclip -selection c -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub is just a bit tedious.
So here&amp;rsquo;s a wrapper function that makes it less of a hassle to integrate the clipboard with the command line.</description>

Bundler decided to install all of your gems from scratch into a ./haml folder. Even when you try bundle update haml, the gems are still going into the ./haml folder! What&amp;rsquo;s going on?
bundle install haml is totally different from bundle update haml.

      <description>I have a script that runs a search and replace on a git status. I recently found out how to do &#39;git config color.status always&#39;, so that git status gives color codes to my functions. However, this broke the substitution, and it took me a while to figure it out.
At the end of every line, there was an invisible &#39;reset&#39; color code, and this meant that &#39;sed &#34;s/string$/$replace&#34;&#39; was no longer finding &#39;string$&#39;.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s nice to add color output to your bash scripts. Here&amp;rsquo;s a small &amp;lsquo;color index&amp;rsquo; reference script for your .bashrc, for when you want to add a bit of color to your scripts.
Save the following script somewhere in your PATH (e.g. /bin/color_index), and make it executable. (chmod +x /bin/color_index)
#!/bin/bash # Bash Colors Index # Shows an index of all available bash colors # ------------------------------------------------ echo -e &amp;quot;\n Usage: \\\e[\*;**(;**)m&amp;quot; echo -e &amp;quot; Default: \\\e[0m&amp;quot; blank_line=&amp;quot;\e[0m\n \e[0;30;40m$(printf &amp;quot;%41s&amp;quot;)\e[0m&amp;quot; echo -e &amp;quot;$blank_line&amp;quot; # Top border for style in 2 0 1 4 9; do echo -en &amp;quot; \e[0;30;40m &amp;quot; # Display black fg on white bg echo -en &amp;quot;\e[${style};30;47m${style};30\e[0;30;40m &amp;quot; for foreground in $(seq 31 37); do ctrl=&amp;quot;\e[${style};${foreground};40m&amp;quot; echo -en &amp;quot;${ctrl}&amp;quot; echo -en &amp;quot;${style};${foreground}\e[0;30;40m &amp;quot; done echo -e &amp;quot;$blank_line&amp;quot; # Separators done echo -en &amp;quot; \e[0;30;40m &amp;quot; # Background colors echo -en &amp;quot;\e[0;37;40m*;40\e[0;30;40m \e[0m&amp;quot; # Display white fg on black bg for background in $(seq 41 47); do ctrl=&amp;quot;\e[0;30;${background}m&amp;quot; echo -en &amp;quot;${ctrl}&amp;quot; echo -en &amp;quot;*;${background}\e[0;30;40m &amp;quot; done echo -e &amp;quot;$blank_line&amp;quot; &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot; # Bottom border  Running &amp;lsquo;color_index&amp;rsquo; will display something like this:</description>

      <description>NOTE: This is only for jailbroken iPhones.
I love finding awesome wallpapers on reddit. My Ubuntu desktop cycles through my wallpaper collection with a program called Cortina, and I wanted my iPhone to do the same.
So I wrote a very simple script and a launchd plist that runs the script every 30 minutes. If you want to set this up for your jailbroken iPhone, all you need is SSH and a collection of images.</description>

      <description>I turned an old brass pressure gauge into a vacant/engaged indicator for our bathroom. The needle is a hacked ammeter, and the metal slide lock on the other side of the door switches it on.
(Inspired by this analog bandwidth meter.)</description>

      <description>I use gedit to write code. I keep a filebrowser tab open at the left side of my screen, and sometimes I need to look at gem&amp;rsquo;s source code. RVM is awesome, and it keeps my 1.8.7 gems, 1.9.2 gems and all my gemsets separated, but this makes it tricky to find the gem you need to look at.
Enter RVM hooks! If you want a symlink to the current gem directory to be updated each time you switch ruby versions, save something like the following code to ~/.</description>

You can sign in with twitter or facebook, add your Gravatar login details, and the app will automatically sync your profile pics across each of your accounts.
It can sync avatars in the following directions:
 Facebook =&amp;gt; Twitter Facebook =&amp;gt; Gravatar Twitter =&amp;gt; Gravatar Gravatar =&amp;gt; Twitter  Unfortunately, the Facebook Graph API doesn&#39;t let us update profile pics at the moment, but I&#39;ll keep looking around for a solution.</description>

      <description>I wanted the LCD screen on my apartment door to display a message on certain days, such as birthdays, Christmas, and Easter. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how hard it was to calculate which day Easter Sunday is&amp;hellip;
def easter(year) c=year/100 n=year-19*(year/19) k=(c-17)/25 i=c-c/4-(c-k)/3+19*n+15 i-=30*(i/30) i-=(i/28)*(1 -(i/28)_(29/(i+1))_((21-n)/11)) j=year+year/4+i+2-c+c/4 j-=7*(j/7) l=i-j month=3+(l+40)/44 day=l+28-31*(month/4) [day, month] end  This happens to be the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon following the northern hemisphere&amp;rsquo;s vernal equinox.</description>

      <description>This is just a little idea I had on the bus.
Outside my apartment, I have a bucket for umbrellas.
A program checks the local weather on weather.com from time to time. If there&#39;s any chance of rain, it switches on the lights installed in the bucket.
So when I walk out the door, I know whether or not I should take an umbrella to work.

      <description>Capistrano is a great tool, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine running a project without it. I always wanted a quick way to know exactly what was running on each of our servers, and needed to know what would would change when I ran &amp;lsquo;cap deploy&amp;rsquo;.
&amp;ldquo;cap deploy:pending&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cap deploy:pending:diff&amp;rdquo; already solve this problem a little bit, but I found them to be too verbose. Also, they don&amp;rsquo;t work so well as part of an automated deploy process since they can require user interaction.</description>

      <title>Rails 3 Rake tasks can take too long to load</title>

      <description>When you run a rake task for a Rails 3 project, it has to load the entire environment since gems can include their own rake tasks. I started to get annoyed by this, because every capistrano deployment would load up rails on my environment just to notify hoptoad.
If you have a very simple rake task that is called very often, you might want to add some work-around code to check for it in the very beginning of your Rakefile.</description>

      <description>We are working with a Rails 3 port of Fat Free CRM. We have so many plugins modifying classes that we have to set config.cache_classes to true. But all our view templates seemed to stay cached as well, and I had to restart the server each time I made a change to a template. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really explain why this was happening, and after a lot of searching I came across this Rails LightHouse ticket.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a daily Calvin and Hobbes RSS feed that parses the comic image from the linked page, and drops it in the feed itself. Perfect for Google Reader.</description>

      <description>Building a ruby gem these days is really, really easy. Bundler provides a great framework generator to get you started. Bundler also lets you install a gem straight from a github repository, so now is the time to say goodbye to your git submodules and start packaging your code into gems.
 Sign up for a rubygems.org account $ bundle gem shiny_new_gem (This creates the framework for your gem) Edit &amp;lsquo;shiny_new_gem.</description>

      <description>When you SSH into your iPhone, or if you use MobileTerminal, you might want to use some of the aliases or functions that you&amp;rsquo;re used to.
To do this:
 Create and edit your &#34;.bashrc&#34; file at &#34;/var/root/.bashrc&#34; Add the following line to &#34;/etc/profile&#34;:  source /var/root/.bashrc  An example alias would be: alias respring=&amp;ldquo;killall SpringBoard&amp;rdquo;
Colored prompts look great in MobileTerminal too.
This is the bashrc that I use on my iPhone.</description>

Its just a 12v relay (rated at 240V/30A), and some cat-5 to the thin client PC. All happens to fit perfectly inside the light switch.

We had a USB Missile launcher lying around, and I thought it could be put to good use. So now, whenever a developer commits a change that breaks a test, he gets shot.</description>

      <description>I was inspired by a makezine.com article I was reading this evening, and decided to follow a tutorial to make an embossed box out of an aluminium can. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything creative for a long time, and I really enjoyed it.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if sanding the outside of the can is completely necessary, since its only visible on the inside of the box. Also, a ballpoint pen isn&amp;rsquo;t the best tool to use, since it leaves blue ink everywhere.</description>

In the meantime, I was dissapointed that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see which song was currently playing in the browser title. So heres a greasemonkey script to do just that:</description>

What you need to do is press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC. Sort by &amp;lsquo;Image Name&amp;rsquo;. Then end these processes: &amp;lsquo;iPodService&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;iTunes&amp;rsquo;.
Your jailbreak should now work fine.</description>

      <description>I like my shortcuts for git (ie. &amp;lsquo;gst&amp;rsquo; for &amp;lsquo;git status&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;gca&amp;rsquo; for &amp;lsquo;git commit -a -m&amp;rsquo;, etc.) But I wanted more, so I thought it would be nice if I could somehow create &amp;lsquo;shortcuts&amp;rsquo; to the filepaths of modified files whenever I run &amp;lsquo;git status&amp;rsquo;. I created a function to export the paths of each modified file into numbered environment variables, and it has really sped up my workflow.</description>

      <description>Heres a simple function to add to your shell if you ever want to replace a string in multiple files at once. It ignores everything in .git, otherwise you get &amp;lsquo;bad index file sha1 signature&amp;rsquo; errors.
function gsed () { if [ -z &amp;quot;$3&amp;quot; ] then echo &amp;quot;== Usage: gsed search_string replace_string [path]&amp;quot; else egrep --exclude-dir=.git -lRZ &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; $3 | xargs -0 -l sed -i -e &amp;quot;s/$1/$2/g&amp;quot; fi }  Add it to the bottom of ~/.</description>

      <title>How to preserve indentation in wordpress [sourcecode] tags</title>

      <description>Dont use the visual editor. Copy the code into your &amp;lsquo;HTML&amp;rsquo; view and it will preserve indentation. Copy it into &amp;lsquo;Visual&amp;rsquo; view and your code will be all left-aligned&amp;hellip;
Examples:
Code pasted in &amp;lsquo;Visual&amp;rsquo; View
&amp;lt;indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/indent&amp;gt;  Code pasted in &amp;lsquo;HTML&amp;rsquo; View
&amp;lt;indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/indent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/indent&amp;gt;  YMMV, I guess, but this is what works for me.</description>

      <title>How to use bundler with multiple Gemfiles in plugins / extensions</title>
      <link>https://madebynathan.com/2010/10/19/how-to-use-bundler-with-plugins-extensions/</link>

      <guid>https://madebynathan.com/2010/10/19/how-to-use-bundler-with-plugins-extensions/</guid>
      <description>Bundler makes it very easy to point to a gem folder on your system, and I definitely recommend this approach a lot more. The plugin can be a gem that we can just require, and it can specify its own dependencies in its .gemspec file.
But if you really don&amp;rsquo;t want your plugin to be a gem, for whatever reason, then read on&amp;hellip;
If we are developing a Spree extension, or a Retrospectiva extension, or a Fat Free CRM plugin, we might sometimes need a way to require the gems in multiple Gemfiles, but Bundler doesn&amp;rsquo;t cater for this.</description>

Solution:
You are using rails 3 (and rspec 2), and trying to define a custom rake task with Spec::Rake::SpecTask.new
Instead, do:
RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:spec) do |t| ...  and make sure to change:
t.spec_files = FileList[&amp;#39;spec/**/*_spec.rb&amp;#39;]  to
t.pattern = &amp;#39;spec/\*_/_\_spec.rb&amp;#39;  </description>

      <description>Every programmer makes mistakes.. But every so often though, you make those mistakes that really mess things up. I just made two of them, and feel like a right n00b.
Both mistakes simply involved overwriting ActiveRecord methods. The first time, I made an &amp;lsquo;update&amp;rsquo; method in my model. And just recently, I realized that I had made a named_scope called &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; for another model.
NEVER use method names such as &amp;lsquo;create&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;update&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;destroy&amp;rsquo; in ANY of your models.</description>

You need an image file that GIMP can open (PNG, GIF, etc.). And you need the command line tool ppmtowinicon from the netpbm-tools (on SuSE you have to have installed the package netpbm). Now perform the following actions:
 Open your image with GIMP. If your image is not a square then resize the canvas with GIMP.</description>

      <description>I needed a way to scan a lot of photos at once. I was going to write a GIMP plugin to extract out multiple images from a single scanned image of 3 or 4 photos, and then rotate them automatically. But as always, someone had already beat me to it :)
See this forum on GimpTalk for the original script.
(The only problem I had is that the Deskew plugin for GIMP is located on a website whose server seems to be permanently offline.</description>

      <description>If you are using an older version of jqGrid because it comes nicely wrapped up in the jquery-grid-rails-plugin, keep in mind that all the demo code is written with the new API introduced in version 3.6. Fortunately, most of the demo code can still be reused with our version of jqGrid (3.5). Just get rid of any &amp;ldquo;jqGrid(&amp;rsquo; ** &amp;lsquo;)&amp;rdquo; function wrappers, and everything should work fine. (I find this easier to do than rewriting the rails plugin for the new version)</description>

Thankfully, someones already done it for me: http://www.2dconcept.com/jquery-grid-rails-plugin
It did take a little while to debug some things that were going wrong, though. Firebug was giving me the error: $.jgrid.formatter is undefined. After some digging around, I realized that no jqgrid locale files were being loaded.
By default, Spree has its i18n locale set to &amp;ldquo;en-US&amp;rdquo;.</description>

To get lcd4linux running on tinycore with any lcd screen, you need the dbus, usbutils and usb-serial packages installed.
At first, lcd4linux was asking me for mysql, and then sqlite, and those are pretty hefty packages for a little thin client.</description>

At work, I found an Advatel TCD226C LED Wallboard. It is a single line, 26 character LED display, that can communicate over RS232. The only problem is that the protocol is proprietary and the manufacturer isnt going to budge.</description>
