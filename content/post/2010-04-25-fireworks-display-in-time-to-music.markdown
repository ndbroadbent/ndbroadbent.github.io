I've had a <a href="http://reaper.fm/">REAPER</a> license for a year or 2 now.
Get rid of Logic Pro and Protools, REAPER is the most awesome music creation software I have ever used.
I love the unparalleled flexibility to make it do whatever you can imagine.

I just followed this
<a href="http://www.davehayes.org/2007/04/27/howto-reaper-on-ubuntu-linux-with-wineasio">extremely helpful
tutorial by Dave Hayes </a> to get REAPER running on Ubuntu with wineasio.
And now, I am in the middle of researching midi plugins that can trigger shell or network events.

My goal is to have REAPER play a song on one track.
I will have another track set up with midi notes that fire off triggers to a plugin.
This plugin will fire an event on my K8055 USB interface board.
This USB board will trigger a relay.
This relay will trigger a charge and set off a fireball in the field behind my house :D.
I work for a stage lighting company in my spare time too, if I can get my hands on some USB -&gt; DMX controllers,
it would be cool to set up a few strobes and halogens as well.

UPDATE (30/09/11):

I actually did set everything up last year, and it was all ready to go, but then .. it rained :(

Next time I'm in NZ I might try this again.
