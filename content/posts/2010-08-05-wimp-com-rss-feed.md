I found out about <a href="http://www.wimp.com">http://www.wimp.com</a> last year, and have been watching their daily videos ever since. Its a simple website that offers 5 or 6 daily videos on a range of topics, such as science, comedy and innovation. And thats all there is. No bells and whistles, just a daily list of 5 videos. The videos are awesome, but I always wanted to watch them with google reader via rss.

So I wrote a simple rss feed/ad-free viewer in rails: Add <a href="http://wimp-rss.heroku.com/rss">http://wimp-rss.heroku.com/rss</a> to your RSS reader. Enjoy :)
