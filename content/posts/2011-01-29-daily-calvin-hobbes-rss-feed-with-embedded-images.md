<a href="https://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a> is fantastic. I wasn't a big fan of yahoo in the past, but their pipes service is amazing. Its great for sprucing up a not-so-well implemented RSS feed, and lets you create feeds from virtually anything on the web.

Here's a <a title="Calvin and Hobbes RSS" href="https://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=4ea8ada9a8b0f29e54ce1056f46f9202&amp;_render=rss" target="_blank">daily Calvin and Hobbes RSS feed</a> that parses the comic image from the linked page, and drops it in the feed itself. Perfect for Google Reader.
