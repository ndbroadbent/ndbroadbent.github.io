title: Scheduling one-off tasks with 'at'

You might be familiar with the [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) job scheduler,
which is great for repeating tasks.
But when you want to schedule a command to only run once in the future,
the [at](https://linux.die.net/man/1/at) command is what you are looking for.

In my case, I was updating a plugin for our
[Thoughtworks Mingle](https://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle-agile-project-management) instance,
but the update wasn't hugely important. Many of our staff rely on Mingle for their work,
and restarting it takes it offline for a few minutes.

So I used the `at` command to schedule the restart to happen at midnight, after everyone had gone home:

```bash
$ echo "/etc/init.d/mingle restart" | at -m 00:00
job 6 at 2012-02-26 00:00
```

Use `atq` or `at -l` to see the list of pending jobs:

```bash
$ atq
6 2012-02-26 00:00 a root
```

Use `at -c <job id>` to view the script that will be run:

```bash
$ at -c 6

#!/bin/sh

# atrun uid=0 gid=0

# mail root 1

umask 22
HOSTNAME=...
<lots of environment variables set here>

/etc/init.d/mingle restart
```

To delete a scheduled task, run `at -d <job id>`:

```bash
$ at -d 6
$ atq
(no output)
```

```

```
