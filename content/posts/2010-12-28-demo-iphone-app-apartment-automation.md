This is the little app I wrote to control my apartment. Its not going to be much use to anyone by itself, but as it says on the github page:

You could use this as a demo app to help you learn about:

<ul>
	<li>InAppSettingsKit
<ul>
	<li>Configure settings from within an iPhone app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>ASI HTTP library
<ul>
	<li>Sending HTTP GET and POST requests with form data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Cloning the ‘slide to unlock’ feature from the iPhone lock screen.</li>
	<li>Using capistrano to deploy an iPhone app straight to your phone over SSH. (for jailbroken phones only)</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
