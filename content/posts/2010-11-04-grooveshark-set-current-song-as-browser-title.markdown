I like Grooveshark. Its like last.fm, but you can choose the songs &amp; albums you want to play. I would like to get a subscription one day, but I'm not sure when the RIAA is planning their attack, so maybe I'll hold off for now :)

In the meantime, I was dissapointed that I couldn't see which song was currently playing in the browser title. So heres a greasemonkey script to do just that:

Hope you find it useful!
