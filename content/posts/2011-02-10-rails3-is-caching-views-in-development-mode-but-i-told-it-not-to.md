We are working with a Rails 3 port of Fat Free CRM. We have so many plugins modifying classes that we have to set <em>config.cache_classes</em> to <em>true</em>.
But all our view templates seemed to stay cached as well, and I had to restart the server each time I made a change to a template. I couldn't really explain why this was happening, and after a lot of searching I came across <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5847-rails-301-configaction_viewcache_template_loading-is-missing">this Rails LightHouse ticket</a>.

We just needed to add this to the end of our <em>environments/development.rb</em> file to clear the view template cache after every request:

```ruby
ActiveSupport.on_load(:after_initialize) do
ActionController::Base.before_filter do
ActionController::Base.view_paths.each(&:clear_cache)
end
end
```

Thanks to <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/users/52307">Eric</a> for this.
```
