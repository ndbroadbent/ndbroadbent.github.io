You are trying to use l1merain to jailbreak on windows xp, but your iPhone doesn't take it.. You should see a green rain drop if the jailbreaking process is successful, but you just see the apple icon.

What you need to do is press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC. Sort by 'Image Name'. Then end these processes: 'iPodService' and 'iTunes'.

Your jailbreak should now work fine.
