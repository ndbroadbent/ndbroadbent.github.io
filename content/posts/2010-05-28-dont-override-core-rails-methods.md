Every programmer makes mistakes.. But every so often though, you make those mistakes that really mess things up. I just made two of them, and feel like a right n00b.

Both mistakes simply involved overwriting ActiveRecord methods.
The first time, I made an 'update' method in my model. And just recently, I realized that I had made a named_scope called 'new' for another model.

NEVER use method names such as 'create', 'update', 'new', or 'destroy' in ANY of your models.. strange things happen!
