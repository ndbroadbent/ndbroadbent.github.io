### Custom sounds for iPhone mail tone and keypad

I've released a few small packages to the modmyi cydia repo.
You can find them by searching for them by name:

<strong>Message For Me â€“ IT Crowd Mail Tone</strong>
Replaces the 'new email' sound with a clip of Moss saying "Message for me!"

<strong>Piano DTMF Tones</strong>
Replaces the keypad sounds in the 'phone' app with piano notes.

<strong>Plants Vs Zombies - Coin SMS Tone</strong>
Plants Vs Zombies Coin SMS Tone

<strong>Crash Bandicoot Sounds</strong>
Replaces iPhone sounds with sounds from the game "Crash Bandicoot" on Playstation 1

<ul>
  <li>SMS Tone - 'Ka-ching'</li>
  <li>New Mail Tone - 'Ooogabooga'</li>
  <li>Sent mail - 'Spinning noise'</li>
  <li>Plug in to power source - 'Wumpa fruit'</li>
  <li>Error/low power - 'TNT'</li>
</ul>
